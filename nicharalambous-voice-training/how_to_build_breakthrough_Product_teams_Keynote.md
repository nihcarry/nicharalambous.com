This little fidget toy is actually the first thing that I ever sold. It's called a begler. And on a family trip to
Greece when I was 15, I decided to buy about 500 of these things and sell them at my school. I sold all 500 within
within a month getting back to school. And the school actually had to ban them because, as you can tell, they're a
little bit distracting. Now, this is me around the same time in my room. That's the computer that I
learned to code on and built my first website when I was 13. My guitar that I taught myself to play is just off the
side there. And those are my golf clubs. And in the background, you see that I've painted a mural on my wall, which my
father did not give me permission for. Now, I was a busy kid.
I was never really waiting for anybody to give me permission to do stuff. I just sort of did stuff. I was curious
about my surroundings and I always just found myself in the process of doing things. None of this stuff would be
considered particularly innovative, but it does show you that I was trying to learn constantly. I was trying to create
something and I was trying to sell and move my life forward even from a young age. And I can't tell you exactly why
this was, but I was always an intrinsically motivated kid. There are people like me in your organization
right now. In fact, I believe that most of you are just like me and uniquely motivated and passionately interested in
your own stuff, right? We're all weirdly different and motivated and interested.
But if this is true, then why don't we all show up every day at work and
innovate? Put simply, trying to do new things with old structures is impossible. old incentives, old methods,
old speeds, old legacy thinking, legacy people doing legacy things in legacy ways. Innovation is a difficult thing to
quantify and measure at the best of times. And now with AI, there feels to be a new innovation every single day of
the week. It's hard to keep up. So if you are sitting in the audience right now and you think that you can be
replaced by AI, then guess what? You can. And if you think your business can be disrupted by AI, it can. AI tools
should no longer be seen as innovative. We've quickly moved past the wonder and all and now towards these tools becoming
imperative and necessary to your work. So today I am not here to talk to you about innovation. Innovation is an
outcome that you only see at the end of a process. It's not an action you can take right now today. And to prove that,
let's do a little experiment. On the count of three, I want you all to innovate. Ready? One, two, three.
Innovate. Nothing. As I expected. See, I'm much
more interested in how we give teams permission to learn, permission to push
boundaries, and permission to fail. How we build our organizations to enable
things that produce innovation. If you think that a speaker on stage can magically provoke an entire organization
to walk out the door and be innovative, I've got some bad news for you. I
believe that the future of business, of your business, is not innovation. I believe that we need to forget about
innovation and empower our teams to be more entrepreneurial, to be self-determined, and to explore.
I believe that traditional hierarchical business structures are dead. Businesses that rely on management to tell workers
what to do and how to do it are dead. Organizations pushing AI tools as silver bullets to keep old systems in place are
dead. They just don't know it yet. Everything is changing all the time. And I know I'm not the only one who has
innovation fatigue. So today I'm not here to focus you on innovation. I am here to refocus you on innovation.
Today, I want you to critically consider your own organization and structures over the next 45 minutes. See, the
organizations of the future is one that cultivates curiosity, one that allows people to act and fail forward. Teams
that explore together, build together, and change the world together. The
structures and the systems of the past will not help us solve the problems of the future. Today I want to introduce
you to the concept of entrepreneurial teams and I want to discuss how you can start building them in your own
organizations. I've spent more than two decades working with the best people in the world
building businesses and entrepreneurial teams that can think and act for themselves that self-determine their
path forward and solve the big and scary problems to change an organization from the inside out.
Self-determination is a right that we have turned into an executive offered
privilege. We take away autonomy in organizations because strong leaders want to control weak employees. This
needs to change today. But instead of looking at internal structures, business leaders across the world think that a
lack of AI is killing their business. And I disagree.
AI is absolutely the largest technological shift in decades. But it is simply a new tool much like
electricity or gunpowder or the printed word or the internet and websites and
social media. We adapt and humans wield these tools. Our organizations don't
need more random AI. We need teams filled with people who have intrinsic motivation to learn, to explore, and to
question the status quo even without the promise of external reward. And we need
to give these entrepreneurial teams permission to explore, permission to act, and permission to fail. History is
filled with examples of worldchanging innovations that did not come from targeted profit-driven mandates or from
wielding new tools for the sake of it, but from pure undirected intellectual
inquiry. Change by nature introduces uncertainty. And human brains typically
respond to uncertainty in the same physiological way as a stress response. We need a system in place to combat this
uncertainty. We need to teach our bodies good things that stem from uncertainty. The uncertainty we face today is more
exciting than almost any time in history. AI has made the world a
different place. So let me repeat, a lack of AI is not killing your business.
A culture of caution is killing your business. Meetings are killing your business. Mediocrity is killing your
business. Processes are killing your business. And bad incentives are killing your business.
AI tools make human traits more important and more relevant than ever before. These companies you see on the
slide are in the business of enabling human creativity and human agency, not
replacing it. If you think that you're being replaced by AI, then again, you are. We all need to start thinking of AI
as a tool to enhance our curiosity and our ability to act and enhance our own
resilience. Those of you sitting pretty, complacent, and calm while the seas of
change rage around you are in trouble. Your ship is capsizing and you think
that a GPT can direct you back to land successfully. Throwing the latest tools at your
existing structures just won't work. Before you can really benefit from the latest AI tools, you need to look
internally and rebuild your organization and empower entrepreneurial teams.
But before we can discuss the right way to build an entrepreneurial team, let's discuss the blatantly obvious wrong way
to build an entrepreneurial team that I have witnessed and experienced in many businesses. Through a series of changes
in direction, bad planning, board leadership, or some really just bad decision-making, an organization becomes
desperate for talent. So, they start to hire quickly, which means they're probably going to hire badly. And
because you're trying to get profitable, you're also trying to hire cheaply. And then because you do that, you don't really trust people. So you don't tell
them their guardrails and you don't really set clear goals and you don't really communicate clear outcomes and
you've never defined some success metrics and then because things start to feel a bit wobbly you slash their
resources, you slash their deadlines, bring everything forward and try and force them to perform. And because that
doesn't work, you implement more process. You give them more meetings to attend. You make them visit more
alignment meetings. You give them more work around the work instead of the real work. And then because things are
flailing, you decide to change goals. You change the outcomes that you never communicated in the first place. And you
don't communicate any of this change to anybody effectively. And then when things start to go belly
up, you implement a culture of blame, you make them jump through hoops of approval. And then a culture of fear
sets in. Now look, you might not recognize all of these, but even one of these problems
can become an infection in the best teams. What do you think happens to the person who leaves a blame ccentric
meeting after they've done? Well, they feel unsafe and they run off and tell their work bestie exactly what's going
on and that if anything goes bad, somebody's head needs to roll and ultimately a culture of decay sets in.
This is not a psychologically safe space for your people to work. Sure,
as the saying goes, people leave managers, not jobs. But culture decay
lets mediocre management thrive and push even more mediocrity.
Entrepreneurial teams are obsessed with being the best, with winning, and with progress, not with mediocrity.
Anything that stands in their way is simply a progress tax on your organization. Work slop becomes the
norm. And if you don't know what work is, it's lazy people abusing AI tools to
record meetings to make meeting notes from the meeting recordings and then to make meeting action plans that AI used
to tell you what to do in the next status and then you over align and you over plan and you underdel while blaming
everybody but yourselves. Their work is the work around the work,
the box ticking, not the true meaningful work. Every meeting that replaces action
is a tax on progress. And entrepreneurial teams do not want to sit in meetings that replace action. They
want to get things done. They want to have the highest standards and be driven by more than what the boss told them.
Meetings that replace actions are attacks on progress. And attacks on progress is attacks on innovation.
I'm willing to bet my beard that an average team with permission to be entrepreneurial and self-determined will
outperform a top team that is bogged down by process, politics, and policy.
Talent is gated by permission. Most experts will tell you to hire A
players. And don't get me wrong, if you're building a business from scratch and you have endless pots of money and equity to give away, then absolutely
this is a great piece of advice. But if you have an existing business like you all do right now, this is terrible
advice. What happens to your profit centers if you have to fire everybody and rebuild your team? And added to
that, the image of an A player is different for everybody. Hell, most C
players I know think that they're A players, but wouldn't know an A player if they were being replaced by one right
now. If you're Mark Zuckerberg and you can offer a $100 million signing bonus to your next genius, amazing.
But I have built and led high agency teams at large businesses. I am an entrepreneurial high agency individual,
someone who acts without waiting permission. And even I have been beaten down by a culture that choked my agency
over years. I can tell you now that AI tools and A players mean nothing without
the appropriate culture to support innovative thinking, innovative experiments, and innovative businesses.
So, what's the answer then? The right people in the right place. I'm not too
concerned with how many A or C players you have in your organization. You don't need A players to build entrepreneurial
teams. What's important is making sure that the right people are working on the
right problems to match their skill level and enthusiasm. Of course, it helps if your entire organization is
filled with a players, but let me tell you now for free. You do not have a company filled with a players. So, what
you can do right now, so what you can do now is use the
players you have and make sure that they're in the right place doing the right work and then give them
permission. Give them permission to be entrepreneurial and self-determined. The right people in the wrong place will
probably fail. The wrong or bad people in the right place could be catastrophic. Just like Mario and
Scorpion you see here. Mario is going to be absolutely decimated if he sticks around and tries to fight in Scorpion
Land. While Scorpion over there, he might win in Mario Land, but I bet you that the land itself won't survive.
You don't want people in your organization who are waiting to see what other people do first or waiting for
leaders to give them something to do or permission to do anything. You want selfdeterministic teams. You
want entrepreneurial teams pushing the boats out into the sea of new and unknown using the AI tools and
experimenting and learning while feeding those lessons back into your organization so it can grow faster. What
got you here won't take you there into the future. And to illustrate my point, I want to
introduce you to the team at Gamma. They're an AI company that helps you build presentations and other things
faster. Each person you see in this picture generates $1.7 million in
revenue for their business every year. They're a team of only 28 people making $50 million a year in revenue. Right at
the outset, they hired T-shaped people and built an entrepreneurial team with
where the thinkers are the doers. Now, a T-shaped person is a generalist with a
deep area of expertise but a wide set of skills in your own company. Now, think about the product manager who can also
code who likes to do marketing and understands design or the engineer who understands narrative and can sell but
can also help with customer service. Those are T-shaped people. Of course, this is the ideal situation to find
yourselves in. It's nice to admire, but it's really tough to build. So, if you are struggling to build this, then what
about giving everybody the best tools and hoping for the best? Well, as with
every tool in human history, how you use it matters more than what it can do. A
pen in the hand can be a weapon of inspiration or a weapon of murder. It all depends on who's holding it and what
they do with it. So my question to you is does the tool make the team or the
team make the tool? Now this is not a rhetorical question. Let's get this
straight. If everybody is using the same tools, then the tools are not a differentiator. I mean do you feel like
using Excel gives you a leg up over your competition? Do you feel like using Microsoft Word makes you better than
your competition? How about browsing or Wikipedia or Google? No. Those tools do
not make experts. Here's another example. Just because everybody has an iPhone doesn't mean that you're all
amazing photographers getting paid to travel the world and replacing professional photographers from their actual jobs. Let's see. By a show of
hands, everybody put your hands up. Every single person in the audience now, if you have an iPhone with a great
camera, keep your hand up. Everybody else, put your hands down. Cool. Now, those of you with your hands up, if you
have an Instagram account, keep your hands up. If you've got more than 5,000 followers, keep your hands up. And
finally, if you've been paid to post something on your Instagram account, keep your hand up. That would make you a
professional. Take a look around. Not many hands up. You see, the tools don't
make experts, and I promise you that the tools won't provoke your entrepreneurial teams to be self-determined and do the
work. Embracing a culture of relentless curiosity is a great way to spark your
entrepreneurial teams into movement. Much like my intrinsic motivation to just do when I was a teenager, I've also
always been intrinsically and relentlessly curious. To be fair, I haven't always been curious about the
most relevant or useful things, but my sense of curiosity has never wavered.
Entrepreneurial people are obsessively and relentlessly curious about the world around them.
And earlier on I told you that the human brain typically responds to uncertainty by triggering the same stress responses
as physical danger. Well, the antidote to this uncertainty is curiosity.
Curiosity transforms that uncertainty from a threat to an invitation.
So, so that we're all talking about the same thing. How do we define curiosity? Well, for me, it's as simple as
curiosity is an intrinsic motivation to learn. It's a high agency act. And we're
going to talk about agency more shortly. But to activate my own curious lens, I'll often ask myself in any situation,
what can I learn from this? It sounds really trivial, but good, bad, up or
down, this question provokes more curiosity. And studies have shown that
we are better at retaining information and learning when we are curious about the subject matter. If people are
obsessed, then they're curious. And if they're free to explore, then they learn more and retain the information.
This is Vanna Fosman, a Berlin doctor who in 1929 stuck a catheter up the artery in his
arm and pushed it around his shoulder through his chest and into his heart to
see if it was possible. He feared that it might kill him. And when it didn't, with the catheter in his
arm, poking at his heart, he walked to the radiology department of his hospital
and asked a colleague to take this X-ray. His obsession led to an
experiment which revolutionized 20th century heart surgery. Or take George
Deestrol, who after a walk in the woods was curious about why the seeds clung to his dog's fur and his coat. His
obsessive inquiry into a very mundane thing led to the invention of Velcro.
There's a clear pattern here. A culture of undirected inquiry is the indispensable first step, the action
towards innovation. But curiosity is not limited to a special few people. You might not be
curious at work right now, but there are three types of curiosity that I'd like to show you so that you can start to
figure out where you are curious in your own life. So to begin with, epistemic
curiosity is this need to understand things deeply, a hunger for knowledge or depth and truth. Then diversive
curiosity is the I want something new, something different, something stimulating type of curiosity. It's it's
like novelty or surprise, a mental restlessness, if you will. It's very much my kind of curiosity. And then we
have empathetic curiosity. This is a need to understand you or your customer
in this case. It's a desire to understand the thoughts and the feelings and experiences of other people. You
might recognize some of these curiosities in your own life. So, how do you use curiosity in everyday life?
Well, here's what I do with my teams. First, we use radical cander, which means we care about each other
personally, but we challenge each other directly. We don't care about ego. You
don't have to choose between being a pushover or a jerk. Using radical cander, avoiding the perils of that
obnoxious aggression or manipulative insecurity and ruinous empathy. You can be kind and be clear at the same time.
This is super important. Then I love to deploy the Socratic method as a reflexive way to challenge my team and
engage in problems. Curiosity in this sense is very structured. It's not fluffy and random. Here's the Socratic
method. It was developed by this old dude that you see over there, Socrates in ancient Greek. And instead of giving
answers, he would ask questions. And in this scenario, the leader, the teacher, somebody in your team would ask probing
questions to expose contradictions and surface assumptions. And then to force clarity, here's a basic structure.
First, ask open-ended questions. Then, you push deeper with follow-up questions. Then, you identify
contradictions or vague thinking and repeat until a clearer, stronger idea emerges.
This is not about winning or losing to be clear. It's about getting to the right question. And I want to give you a workplace example. If you launch a new
product, but something goes bad, you would start to ask yourselves, well,
what specifically is down? When did we first notice the drop? What changed around this time? What user journey is
happening? How are people responding to that user journey? Are we even following the user journey? What would be the first thing we would change if we would
start all over again? And then one of my favorite questions is who on the team disagrees with our current approach and
why? Inviting disscent is super important here. All of these questions
really exist to uncover a simple but powerful question. Are we solving the
right problem? This is a deeply Socratic workplace question. And now the best
solutions don't always come from where you expect. Very often it's the smashing together of unexpected things that
provide the most interesting solutions. Like you might really love technology
but also thoroughly enjoy the act of trail running. who might love to fish
but also enjoy designing apps and software engineering. A powerful demonstration of this crossindustry
curiosity is the team at the great Orman Street Hospital in London. They were
faced with really high patient casualty rates when transferring patients from the operating room to recovery. And to
help solve this, physicians started looking all over for answers. And they found some in Formula 1 racing team's
pit stop procedures. and they started to implement their own version of these procedures and saw a massive drop in the
failure rates in their patients transfers. This is a great illustration of looking outside of your industry and having
unbridled curiosity solve a problem. Moreover, curiosity directly enhances
resilience and prevents us from getting dumber. Because believe it or not, AI
tools are quickly making humans dumber every day. A recent MIT study showed
that for many people AI is making us what they called cognitively bankrupt.
So a team of MIT researchers used EEG brain scans on 54 participants over four
months. The participants were split into three groups. The first group had chat
GPT to answer essay questions with. The second group was given search engines like Google to answer their questions
with and the final group was a brain only group and they were asked to answer three essay questions over the course of
four months and their brains were scanned in the process and the results were absolutely shocking. Brain scans
revealed the damage in AI users neural connections collapsed from 79 to 42.
That is a 47% reduction in neural connectivity. Imagine if your computer
all of a sudden just lost 50% of its ability to compute. Now, this isn't
opinion to be clear. This is measurable brain damage from AI usage. But there is
good news here. People with a strong cognitive baseline showed higher neural
connectivity when using AI than chronic users who relied on it entirely. In
short, a curious mindset promotes psychological flexibility which is
crucial for navigating uncertainty. The AI tools we have should be used to
amplify human curiosity, not replace it. So if you tell people what to be curious
about, if you tell them how to be curious, if you tell them where to be curious and when to be curious and why to be curious, I can guarantee you that
you will kill curiosity in your organization. So if you don't want to do that, remember these three things.
First, constantly ask yourself and your teams, what can we learn from this?
Second, use the Socratic method to try and figure out if you're solving the right problem to begin with. And
finally, remember that AI should amplify human curiosity. It should not replace it. AI should not be leading your
actions. It should be enhancing your bias towards action. So now I've
convinced you of the value of curiosity. And your brain is firing, exploring, and thinking. I want to point you towards
one of the most important differences between the teams in your organization right now and an entrepreneurial team.
And that is a strong bias towards action regardless of where they find themselves. A different way to say a
bias towards action is high agency. So what is agency to begin with? Agency is
the ability to act without waiting for permission. And if agency is acting
without permission, then how would you even recognize high agency? Well, the author George Mack has popularized the
concept of high agency. And he likes to pose one question that I'm going to ask you today.
You wake up, that's me, waking up in a developing world prison and you're only allowed to call one person to know that
they're going to get you out of that prison. Who are you going to call? Why did you choose this person? What is
it about them that made you pick up the phone and phone them? Well, this person has something, right? They've got a
spark. They've got a janisa. That something that's high agency.
So, think about this right now. Who's calling you? Are you a high agency
person? Who on your team is getting a phone call? And who's just ticking boxes?
I'll bet you right now, some of you are sitting in the audience and thinking, "Oh, but Nick, that's not fair. Some people were just born with high agency.
Some people are given more permission than others. Some people have got privilege that I don't. They've got a leg up that I don't. Life's just easier
for some people than others." I call That's completely unfounded.
And I want to point out that that's also low agency thinking. Agency is not a finite resource. You're
not born with it. Our societies, our schools, our organizations and businesses and religions, they all set
out to limit our agency in different ways. High agency is a muscle that you
can grow. It's a skill that you can level up. It's a power up that you can activate.
So, how do you activate this power up? Well, firstly, in 1954, Julian Rutter
coined the term locus of control to describe how people interpret events.
You have an internal locus of control, which is I influence what happens to me, or an external locus of control, which
is things happen to me. Agency starts as a belief. If you believe you can change
outcomes, you will. If you believe your actions matter, they do. If you believe
your experiments will make a difference, you will experiment. Secondly, Albert Bandura showed that
confidence in your ability to achieve a goal boosts your motivation and your
follow through of that goal. Said another way, self-efficacy is the belief
in your own ability to execute on a specific task or goal. You don't act
because you are confident. You are confident because you act. You then
succeed and the loop builds itself. And then finally, James Clear's central
point in his book about called Atomic Habits applies so perfectly to agency.
You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
People's behavior is shaped more by their environment than the willpower they possess. Even high potential, high
agency individuals lose their agency in a system that punishes initiative and
drowns them out in friction. Now, here's the thing. Just because you think maybe you have low agency at work,
it doesn't mean you are a low agency person. Take a look at your own life right now. Where do you practice high
agency already? You're not entirely passive. You don't walk through life doing nothing. You choose, you act, you
decide, you maneuver. You have passions and hobbies that you actively engage in.
You have what I call selective agency. I've been playing guitar since I was 12. That is nearly 30 years of playing this
instrument. And as much as I wish I looked like that very cool guy over there on the screen, I don't. But I
still choose to act with agency every time I sit down and practice. You choose where to use your agency. And
I guarantee you, you you choose to use your agency where it is rewarded. And I
know from experience that agency is not rewarded in most workplace environments. Even if you want it to be, it's just
not. Brian Armstrong is the CEO of Coinbase and he famously said that
action produces information. I couldn't agree more. The more you act, the more information you have to react to and be
curious about. The converse is also true. No action means no information
means no curiosity. for a second. If we bring back innovation here and we assume that to reach the end state of
innovation, you need to actually do something. Well, how do you know what to do? Act and find out. How do you know
what your customers want? Act and see what they say. Or better yet, act and
ask them. Action produces information. And if you're stuck, you need to act.
This is why the concept of a bias towards action is so imperative to building entrepreneurial teams. Without
action, there is no information. And without information, there's nothing to learn, nothing to build, and nothing to be curious about. You're stuck.
A diary study in 2019 showed that on days that employees took more initiative
on their own by anticipating and solving problems they could foresee, they were happier and more engaged at work.
Looking ahead, preempting and being proactive gave them purpose.
Encouraging agency isn't just good for output. It fulfills employees needs for
meaning, for engagement, which in turn reduces staff turnout, and even burnout.
Elon Musk might be a very divisive character, but it is undeniable how innovative he is. In an interview this
year, he told the audience that he believes innovation can be learned by simply asking one question.
Did you try it? Did you try to create something new? Did you try to solve this problem? Did you try to uncover the
reason this exists? Did you try to talk to that colleague that you don't like? Did you try something? Now, I want to
push a word of caution here. Remember that a bias towards action is not a bias
against planning. Planning is imperative. But the map is not the
terrain. You might want to get to Rakes Museum in Amsterdam when you're on holiday there, but when you get out into
the world after looking at the map, you don't see taxis. You don't see Ubers, you see bicycles, and none of them are
yours. You take a turn to the right and instead of seeing a car that you want to hire, you see an empty road. And when
you eventually get to the museum, instead of seeing an empty door, you see hundreds of people standing in your way.
The map is not the terrain. But remember that tools don't make people smart. You
might have a map, but you need to walk the path. Much like my buddy Michael Scott when he listened to his GPS and
drove himself directly into a lake. It's how you use the tools. It's what you pay
attention to. It's you. It's human that matters.
So to be clear, even if you have a map, even if you know the terrain, your
action is not asking AI to do the work. That is unfulfilling. Remember that MIT research we were
discussing earlier? A shocking 83% of the chat GPT users couldn't quote from
an essay they wrote minutes earlier. Let that sink in and let's apply that to your work.
You spend Monday using AI to build a report and you let it do the thinking and acting for you. You send that report
to your colleagues and that Monday afternoon you go into a meeting and you will not remember the report. You write
something, you hit save and your brain has forgotten it because you've outsourced your thinking and acting to
GPT. So if you want to start building an organization that acts and remembers
what they learn, then it's really important that you understand that you have selective agency already. You just
need to select to use it at work. Remember that action produces information. Without action, you have no
information. So constantly ask yourselves, did you try it? And finally, innovation doesn't wait for permission.
Start building a culture and internal structures that reward action. Don't not
waiting for permission. Give people their agency through small wins. Help your team by creating structures that
reward initiative. For now, remember that action is only a failure when it
prevents you from trying again. Teams that are curious and are empowered to act are often fearless in failure. Dying
businesses look at failure as fatal. Failure is not fatal. Failure is a
through point. It's not an end point. Entrepreneurial teams understand that
the only path to success is failure that is not catastrophic. We need to start seeing failure as data
not destiny. Entrepreneurial teams hurdle towards failure as rapidly as they can. The only difference between
data and disaster is how the organization deals with that failure thereafter. I spent the first decade of
my life building businesses and failing. Literally from the age of 16 to 26, I was one big fat entrepreneurial failure.
Hell, I even wrote a bestselling book about it. The most informative years of my life, I learned that failure is data,
not destiny. This is how most successful teams innovate. They fail a lot, but
they don't see failure. They see lesson. They see data. They see a pivot, a bit
of information slowly moving them towards their end goals. But don't take it from me. This is one of the greatest
inventors of our time, James Dyson. And he famously built 5,127
prototypes of the Dyson vacuum cleaner before discovering this single way to build a vacuum cleaner without a bag.
It's important that I repeat that. 5,127
prototypes. Now, be honest when I ask you this question. When was the last time you gave up on something difficult
after one try? It took Dyson 14 years to
create the final version that he was happiness happy with. That means that there was no innovation
for 14 years. There was only curiosity, a bias towards action and an obsessive
focus with lots of failure. And then after 5,127
prototypes and 14 years of trying, there was an innovation.
Now, this system of learning by doing isn't random. It was a philosophy pioneered by John Dwey. It's the
foundational idea that people don't learn by passively memorizing information. They learn by doing, by
experiencing, by engaging. I believe that this is going to be one of the most integral lessons that we teach our teams
in the future. To learn, they must do. Remember that Gamma team that we showed
earlier? They proved to us that thinkers can be doers in an entrepreneurial team. And you know what? Doers learn faster.
Dubie argued that true education happens when learners tackle real world problems. They experiment, collaborate,
and reflect rather than waiting for instruction. Kind of sounds like an entrepreneurial team. They learn by
tackling a real problem, experimenting, failing, collaborating, practicing the Socratic method, and reflecting rather
than waiting for a CEO to tell them what they did wrong. We are socialized to be fearful of
failure. We are taught at school that if we don't pass, if we don't do amazingly,
you won't go to university. you don't get that job you want and you live a less meaningful life. Failure is seen as
an end point as game over. But this is fundamentally flawed and it's an
outdated way of thinking about the world in business. In a world where everything is moving so quickly, you need to try.
And I believe that you have only truly failed if you have not bothered to try.
And here's the thing, our organizations create environments where people are afraid to try. So, we need to start
undoing that work. And what you can do right now is implement what Etsy calls a blameless post-mortem.
After an incident or a massive failure of any kind, they have a structured debrief. They bring together people
involved. And here, blameless means no fear-based blame. Attendees are
empowered to tell people what they did, to tell them what their assumptions were, to tell them what they witnessed
and what they wanted to do instead of did without the fear of punishment. This
shifts the narrative in those meetings from who messed up and how do we fire them to what system, context or process
did we implement that we should change. Sharing failure is an imperative for any
organization trying to rapidly retool for the AI era. Entrepreneurial teams need to quickly understand their
colleagues mistakes, failures, datas, lessons, and learn from them. Studies have shown that firefighters who
debriefed on case studies of errors made by more experienced colleagues were better equipped to handle new problems
than those who only studied successes. A failure shared is a failure h haveved.
If your goal is to gather information as fast as possible and distribute it into your teams, then you need to start implementing blameless postmortems to
help people overcome their fear of failure. This is how you build strong, resilient, blameless teams.
So now we've got people in your business who are relentlessly curious and they're holding a very strong bias towards action. So let's give them the
structures to fail positively. And remember that failure is data, not destiny. A failure shared is a failure
harved. So start talking to your teams about failure more openly and implement blameless postmortem so people aren't
fearful of losing their jobs if they make a mistake. These are three underlying traits that successful
self-determined teams engage when they are trying to produce something new or innovative. This is what I call my
innovation flywheel. This is an active system that turns your teams from passive workers into
entrepreneurial teams that are self-determined. Leaders want team members to take
initiatives, be inventive, use the latest tools, but then punish people when they move too fast or do something
that the organization doesn't do. Our organizational structures and incentives have not caught up with our tools. This
is like using dialup modem to browse Tik Tok on your iPhone.
Before your organization can innovate, which is an external outcome that the world sees, you need to innovate, which
is an internal change that can start today. Now, we've got all these components. Let's string them together and see how
they work. If you have a thesis that you're curious about, plan some action, get some
information, and then see how the flywheel kicks itself off. If you don't, and you've just taken some action, no
problem. That action leads to more information, either a failure or a success. And that failure or success
leads to more curiosity. And if you've already had some failures or successes, then go back and analyze the data and be
more curious. Explore the information and take new action which will lead you to new information through a failure or
a success. Remember, innovation is an outcome, not
an action. You can't innovate by innovating. Before you can produce something that
the external world considers innovative, you need to look inside of your organization and innovate first. The
innovation flywheel doesn't force your team to use the new AI tools, but it creates a culture where they want to
solve bigger problems in faster ways by using AI tools. To do this, I don't need
you to do everything all at once. Just pick one of the following things and get started next week. Give people
permission to be curious. Then reward action over approval and start treating
failure as data, not destiny. If you want to start implementing the innovation flywheel and learn more about
guardrails or outcomes, the metrics and rituals, the trust and the structures that go along with the innovation
flywheel to build the initial drive for this, just pop me an email. Thank you so
much for your time. I really loved giving this talk.
