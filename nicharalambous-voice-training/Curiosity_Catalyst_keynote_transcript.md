i'm going to ask you a few questions when was the last time you felt truly
madly obsessively curious about something at work
when was the last time you forgot what time it was when you were engaged with a problem do you think that your company is at the
coalface of innovative discoveries in your industry what would it take to turn your business
into the most innovative company in the world i've always been an insatiably curious
kid my greek mother likes to tell people that i was walking and talking before anybody else my age
i'm not entirely sure that that is true because greek mothers will be greek mothers
but i can't tell you that i was always that irritating child who would rather sit with your parents than play with you
on a playdate and i became that irritating child who booked a conference meeting with my headmaster
when i was 16 years old sat down at the table and told him that i was bored with school
he looked me in the eye and said give it two years and he was right my matricula was brutal
but i've always been curious and this is curious nick trying to stick his big toe
in his ear and see seeing if it would fit it did not fit this is curious nick sitting being happy
wondering what his grandmother is doing in the corner and then the next instant this is curious nick having a fat cry
because i think i was trying to figure out how far my ice cream would tip before it fell off the cone
and then it fell off the cone and this is nick with his silly face on
i love this face this face is disarming it lets people know that they can ask me stupid questions and that i'm allowed to
ask stupid questions this silly face opens me up to learning it's not threatening and people like my silly
face because they're comfortable enough to be silly around me i want to know does your company have a
silly face do your leaders proudly display their own silly faces do you have a silly face that you put on when
you're curious about something or are you always the smartest person in the room
is your company too afraid to admit ignorance for a few moments to gain better understanding and insight into
the problems that you were trying to solve do you allow yourself the space to be curious and discover innovative
solutions when i was a kid i was also obsessed with this movie this is back to the
future and for those of you in the audience who love this movie as much as i do it came out 32 years ago
that makes me feel old but it is 2021 that we were promised flying cars
and we wanted flying cars but instead we got 140 characters this is a quote from peter thiel who is
one of the founders of paypal he was one of the first investors in facebook and he is the founder of the
founders fund and investment firm teal amongst other influential philosophers economists investors
thinkers believe that we are going through something called the stagnation hypothesis
that there has been a significant slowdown in technological scientific and economic progress over the last few
decades for a round number since the 1970s for around the last 50 years stagnation here
means slower progress than expected could be in manufacturing and construction agriculture energy
transport information or in medicine and let's go through some of the
fundamental advancements over the last 300 years or so there were three fundamental
advancements in the first industrial revolution in mechanization steam power and the locomotive
there were two five fundamental advancements in the second industrial revolution in oil and combustion
electric power electronic communication industrial chemistry and germ theory think about that one for a second before
the mid-1800s we did not know why we got sick we are still benefiting from the
advancements in germ theory today in this pandemic and then
there has been one fundamental advancement in the third industrial revolution which takes us to roughly the
mid 19th 1900s which is 1970 50 years ago or so and that was in computing and
digital communication let's not take away from that the digital revolution has been absolutely
astounding we sent a self-driving robot to another country and it has sent us back the
first sounds of another planet that is absolutely astounding
elon musk and spacex have a spaceship that is absolutely massive that can fly
10 kilometers into the atmosphere and land exactly back on the spot where
it took off from completely reshaping space travel for perspective think of the biggest
favorite football field that you've ever attended lie the spaceship on its side and it is
20 meters taller than your favorite football field we can send that into the
moon but we are still using technology that is more than 50 years old
the computer is now 75 years old the microchip is a whopping 50 years old things have not progressed as
significantly as we would like to have hoped using that technology we have managed to build insane advancements but the
fundamental underlying technology is not innovative any longer it's iterative and potentially stagnant it's not
forward-looking now i want you to think about your business in relation to this idea of stagnation
is the underlying technology of your business stagnant are there parts of your business right now that you can
think of that need a jolt of electricity to wake it up and move it forward what would your business look like if
you started from scratch today are you suffering from a stagnant
company hypothesis if you hesitated to answer the previous questions or you answered yes to any of
them then perhaps your team or a division or a business unit may be stagnant
perhaps your culture your product your profits your processes or marketing your sales strategy or customer service needs
to evolve and develop beyond where it has stagnated to right now
this stagnant company hypothesis could lead you to be cynical you could believe
that you are exempt from the stagnation that your business is different
but what if you're wrong what if embracing the stagnation hypothesis and suspending your cynicism
for the next 40 minutes could fundamentally change everything you do going forward
i want to take on this idea that your company is sluggish and lacks vitality and i want to present you with a single
concept that could jolt you back into action when i talk about these problems and the potential pitfalls what jumps to your
mind what is the thing the skill the silver bullet that you and your team and
colleagues need to engage to break out of the stagnant company hypothesis
well right now most leaders most pundits most experts will advise
that the way to beat stagnation is to simply innovate today i'm going to war with stagnation
and i'm going to war with our twisted and mangled idea of what innovation has become
i know what's happening in many businesses around the world one day a ceo or a bus or a manager starts telling
their teams to turn on innovation they're getting pressure from their buses buses bus who's getting pressure
from her boss and shareholders who's getting pressure from everybody to innovate and compete
so people start scrambling the panic is real and visceral and the company turns to what i call
wackovation innovation by reaction where you are not solving a problem for your customers
you are not creating something new or different or interesting you are simply innovating out of reaction to an
external variable that you have no control over a competitor pops up and
does something new and threatening so your team responds without deeply understanding the problem or customer
you are trying to attract that is whack ovation who remembers the zune from microsoft
this bad boy over here microsoft was not solving a problem when they released this mp3 player they were
reacting to a problem that apple had created they were reacting to the ipod nano and the very first version of the
ipod who remembers this guy crazy they were not curious about their
customers experience microsoft were not interested in figuring out anything other than a response to apple's move in
the space this is wackovation the ipod was the first truly great mp3
player with innovation innovative dead simple user interface terrific industrial design and the polish that
defines apple's products today it became the de facto device around the world everything after it could be seen as
rackivation we know how that ended for apple with a 2.5 trillion dollar valuation
the ipod completely shifted the market the customer the problem and their business
of course i know that their 2.5 trillion evaluation is much more nuanced than the ipod but you get my point
now i'm going to describe a common occurrence in corporates around the world and i hope that you don't recognize it
have you ever been given just enough budget to run out of money just enough time to miss a deadline
and just enough support to feel unsupported and out of these gifts you were tasked
with coming up with something to show the world that you are innovative and charging forward so your shareholders
reward you this is called innovation theater microsoft was not solving a problem they
were innovating as a reaction and providing shareholders with a little bit of theater so they could eke out some
value this is innovation theater the lackluster combination of wackovation
and innovation theater just doesn't work it's a band-aid on a bullet wound
it's lipstick on a pig and it leads to businesses acting like bulls in a china shop and right now you
could be a bull in your own china shop trying to innovate your way out of a room filled with china by thrashing
around instead of taking a break and constructing a brilliant strategy
towards the open door of innovation and curiosity that leads you to an open
market instead of finding the door you simply destroy all the inventory
your existing business model so that you can seem like you are being innovative
new and different
when you sit in a boardroom how do you innovate
what does that look like when you get that instruction from your buses buses buses shareholder and you
gather with the smartest people in your company what exactly does the talking head at the end of the table say
to make it an innovative meeting what does it look like practically think about this for a moment do you dress up
in an innovative way do you say new words that never existed before and hope that they become part of your lexicon do
you sit and hope that randomly innovation shall appear into existence and magically become something useful to
you no of course not you don't and why why don't you do that why don't you know
how to do that because innovation is not an action
innovation is not a verb innovation is not the journey
it is not a thing you do innovation is a noun
innovation is an outcome and if every consultant and every expert
has been wrong over the past decade about innovation if there is no way to innovate your way
out of problems if you are a bull sitting in a china shop thrashing around destroying your inventory and hope of
building a better business then how do you actually create change in an organization
how do you leap forward in the world there is one word there is one intrinsic trait that humans
have untethered from innovation that needs to be brought back with vengeance
there is one thing that is going to enact change in your life and in your business
that one deeply human trait that we are programmed to ignore is curiosity
curiosity is the god particle of innovation and curiosity leads to change
curiosity is the action you have been looking for it is the start of everything new every leap forward every
fundamental shift in society in business and in our lives started
with curiosity there is no innovation without curiosity
unsurprisingly there are obviously obsessively curious people who are obsessively curious about curiosity in
the workplace one of these people is francesca gino and her academic research into the topic
is groundbreaking in the world of innovation if you apply it appropriately her studies at an enterprise level have
shown us that fewer decision-making errors occur if you promote curiosity to your teams
more innovative decisions happen positive changes occur in creative and non-creative jobs
we reduce group conflict we have more open communication better
overall team performance we have an avoidance of confirmation bias
if we just promote curiosity at a base level in our companies
in a study of 200 employees from various companies and various industries employees were sent a text message twice
a day for four weeks they were broken up into two groups group one was sent this message
what is one topic or activity you are curious about today what is one thing you usually take for
granted that you want to ask about group number two was sent this what is one topic or activity you'll
engage in today what is one thing you usually work on or do that you will also complete today
after four weeks one group scored higher when answering questions about innovation and their actions at work
over that period you guessed it just asking people what they were
curious about led to higher levels of innovative actions at work
in another study of three thousand employees from different companies in different roles in different industries
people were asked about their levels of curiosity at work a shockingly low 24 percent felt any
curiosity to anything that they did at all at work an even more horrendous stat of 70
of people surveyed felt barriers to curiosity in their job
that is unbelievable these organizations have erected roadblocks that are presenting
preventing people from being curious here's the thing we do not have an
innovation problem in workspaces we have a curiosity problem
so it's important to understand why curiosity is discouraged in the workplace to begin with in her work around
corporate innovation and rebels francesca gino discovered that this curiosity problem kicks in at work very
quickly curiosity wanes the longer you are at your job within 12 months your
reported levels of curiosity take an absolute dive workers are hired to do their jobs
workers are not hired to think about process they're not hired to be curious
they are not hired to be obsessed with the problem they are obsessed with being efficient
and reaching what is known as the okay plateau in his book moonwalking with einstein
joshua bumps into the okay plateau while trying to become a memory champion foe is trying to improve his memory so
he can compete in memory competitions but at some point in his training he stops improving this is the okay plateau
and it's intimately tied to the act of practicing and engaging curiosity
your new hires are hired to do a job and then they learn to do that job very well and they are rewarded for that then they
practice this over and over and the rewards continue for their efficiency
they are never rewarded for curiosity for mistakes that lead to improvements
they have plateaued and we reward them for that we reward our teams for doing the same
repetitive job well with very few mistakes we allow our teams to plateau and we very rarely ask
them to improve without fear of failure another reason we don't promote
curiosity is we reward attendance over performance we give people star ratings for showing up for putting in long hours
and for doing more work than anybody else we judge people on their attendance we make them work the same hours every day
all day and correlate their results to their attendance of those hours it's tough to be obsessively curious
when you are judged on hours and not performance and you're not given the space and freedom to be curious without
fear of failure and then finally mindset is one of the key reasons we do
not promote curiosity in the workplace leaders often have the wrong mindset about curiosity in a survey of 520 chief
learning officers and chief talent development officers it was found that they often shy away from encouraging
curiosity because they believe the company would be harder to manage if people were allowed to explore their
own interests again we seek efficiency at the detriment of organizational progress
exploration often involves questioning the status quo and it doesn't always produce useful information immediately
we often have to not settle for the first answer when we are being curious in exploring possibilities and that is
not an efficient use as we understand efficiency at a corporate level
if innovation is not an action and we understand that curiosity creates change what's next for our businesses
what can we do to engage our teams to restructure our organizations and rethink how we operate in this new and
ever-evolving society well what we can do is implement my curiosity catalyst
and here it is as an overview first you have to work with or hire the best people
you have to let them obsess over a big problem and give them the freedom to experiment without fear of failure
while we help them think long term so what do i mean when i say the best
people well in a study of 120 employees it was found that natural curiosity was
associated with better job performances evaluated by their direct buses
natural curiosity means better job performance now i don't mean this kind of natural
curiosity i can't imagine what led the person in the bottom left-hand corner to figure
out that he could squirt milk out of his eye across the room into a glass
or what possessed the person in the top right hand corner to actually go out and let thousands of bees sit on his face
there are humans who become obsessed with all kinds of things and more power to them but i'm more referring to people like
charles darwin who created the theory of evolution and natural selection but he didn't set out
to change the world in that way darwin was actually obsessed with marine invertebrates that's right
with the octopus he neglected his cambridge education and headed out on a five-year voyage on the
hms beagle and established himself as an imminent geologist while he stumbled upon the theory of
natural selection and evolution so what do these people actually look like well a little bit like mr t
but not physically of course i mean a t-shaped person a jack-of-all-trades and a master of one
people like auret gadish the chairperson of banenko she reads over 100 books a year in various fields
including maths biographies physics history as well as the history of every
country she visits in person then we have nasim taleb who we all know
his reading and writing covers finance and math philosophy social sciences legal theory and finance but he goes
deep into the social sciences paul robson is a well-known pro athlete
but he was also a multilingual speaker an actor a singer a civil rights activist a scholar and a lawyer
these people are all expert generalists people like aristotle whose writing
covered metaphysics and poetry physics logic music theater rhetoric government
politics biology ethics zoology but went deep into philosophy an expert generalist
then you have maya angelou who we all know is an incredible poet but she was also an actor a singer a dancer and an
author these people had expertise that went wide an experience that went deep
to create something interesting and unique these people all shared traits they were
resilient and inquisitive they were ambitious effective at what they did they were inspired
but mostly they were obsessive and the thing that i've learned from
people like this is that obsession opens opportunity and when i talk about obsession i mean
obsession like dr vana fossman had in 1929 he was curious and obsessed with
the idea of figuring out if the artery in his arm was directly linked to his
heart so he stuck a catheter up the artery in his arm while he was awake without
anesthetic and pushed it around his shoulder through his chest and into his heart to see if it was possible
he feared that it might kill him and when it didn't he walked with the catheter touching his heart to
the radiology department of his hospital and asked a colleague to record his discovery on x-ray
his experiment revolutionized 20th century heart surgery and this is the
image you see in front of you this is the face of obsessive curiosity
so i was fortunate enough to be talking to the founder of electronic arts and i asked him how he built his company where
it all started and it's a fascinating story of long-term thinking and obsession
in the late 60s trip was playing dungeons and dragons with his friends they'd get up from the game
and move over to this new fancy box with moving pictures on it a tv
and he says he was looking at the game and his imagination was on fire and he looked to his left and his
friends were sitting blank-faced staring at the tv screen and there and then at the age 15 or 16 he understood that he
needed to take his experience of board games and put them on television but
technology wasn't catching up with his obsession fast enough so like any teenage boy would do
he wrote a business plan at the age of 15 or 16 he wrote a business plan on how
he would build electronic arts when the technology catches up and then he started studying he went to
university and he studied design and he started diving into technology and he got a job at apple as one of the first
employees working directly with steve jobs he put himself and his obsession at the forefront of technology
until technology caught up and then many years later he took his business plan out and started building
characters like these that we now know as electronic arts a
billion dollar business this is obsession and obsession opens opportunity for people like tripp and
businesses like yours the next part of the curiosity catalyst
is experimentation and i've learned from people like tripp that experiments enable action
but the kind of organization that empowers experimentation is a learning organization and peter senge pioneered
the concept of a learning organization off the back of his systems thinking systems thinking focuses on how the
individual that is being studied interacts with the other parts of the system today we're focusing on
innovation and curiosity each system requires various parts to work together to continue to be effective and if one
part changes dramatically without considering the others then the system breaks think about your company and the
departments that you're in your relationships your colleagues and life in general can you think of a part of a
system that breaks right now i bet you you can a learning organization is a company
that facilitates learning for all of its members top to bottom and helps to transform itself in an ongoing basis
healthy organizations promote learning scared and defensive people and organizations do not want you to learn
they do not want you to be curious they do not want you to think differently entrenching curiosity into your business
is a key part of creating a learning organization that strives and innovates
and i want to go back to photo's okay plateau here the ok plateau is everywhere in
corporates and a fantastic way to overcome this and help your teams to learn more is to allow them to
experiment and help them learn new things pushing people out of their comfort zones learning from one another
each day in a structured way to move beyond what they know and how they do
things to come up with solutions that are more creative and innovative for the long term an organization that does this
exceptionally well is a company called onfido they if you don't know are the company
that verifies your identification online and they hire for curiosity they promote
peer-to-peer learning they hire for lifelong learning as well as engage their teams to learn from one another
and how does unfit or hire for lifelong learning well the ceo told me that when starting out he used to ask a very
simple question to everybody he interviewed for a hire he would simply ask people what they were curious or obsessed with that had
nothing to do with work it's the smashing together of unexpected things that make people interesting and
interested on fido allows their most junior staff to learn and teach their most senior
staff and vice versa and they also do this incredible thing around experimentation that every business
should adopt any employee at on fido can go to their immediate boss and justify for a small
amount of budget to try and test the theory that they might have that is relative to the work that they're doing
if that goes well and they use the money effectively they can justify for further budget and then for further budget and a
team and then a bigger team until they have a company-wide project and they are solving a fundamental problem that is
shifting the direction of their business curiosity grows from the bottom up it does not follow gravity
it emerges from any orifice of your business if you allow it to do so
but the key thing is your teams cannot fear failure if those experiments don't work
we need to re-frame failure and remember that failure is not fatal
if failure is fatal you're doing it wrong perhaps think about doing something else failure is not an end point failure is a
through point it is not something to be feared but something to teach us what didn't work what could work what almost
works and what we can do better failure is something your teams should not avoid but should work towards in
small increments that don't break the back of your organization but act as calculated lessons that are good use of
budgets failure should spark curiosity and this failure sparks one hell of a
curious question in my mind isn't this just such a fantastic image it's jarring
if this image doesn't send your brain spinning and asking a million questions then i'm not sure we can be friends
anymore like how did this plane get there did anybody die what did the pilot do why are the trees growing around it
failure promotes curiosity with great curiosity comes great failure and with great
failure comes great curiosity teams cannot be afraid to fail if they are
fearful of losing their jobs they will not experiment and they will not be curious
they'll just do their work failure is a learning it's an integral part of moving towards success and if
you're looking for a silver bullet and quarterly results your failure is devastating
failure is a through point not an end point there is no success without failure along the way our job is to make
the failures small enough that they don't break the back of your organization and one company that understands this in
a fundamental level is 3m this is an actual image of their office at one point and it says
curiosity is just the beginning one of their team members in the 1920s was a young guy named richard gurley
drew and back then there was this popular two-tone paint job
and richard's job was to go around and give samples
richard's job was to go around and give samples of sandpaper to each of his
clients to make sure that they were getting the latest use of 3m's fantastically innovative sandpaper
and so time and time again richard would go into these workshops and see the painters struggling with the two-tone
paint jobs they would put something across the top to make sure that it didn't get the bottom paint on it but it would fall off and damage the paint job
or the sticky thing they had would rip the paint off once it was done until he went back to one of his buses
and he was thinking about this two-tone paint job and he realized that as a lab assistant
he had the resources in front of him to experiment and find a solution so he asked if he could do this
and two years of experimenting later richard had taken the gun that was used
on the sandpaper and experimented with it enough that he had come up with what we now know as scotch tape or masking
tape this completely changed the way the 3m sees their business and engages with
their team this kind of progress is only there when your people are not
afraid to fail they're given the freedom to experiment there are lots of organizations
reframing failure embracing experimentation google's adsense was a project that emerged out of their 20
time and now is one of their biggest revenue spinners atlassian has pioneered the idea of a hackathon as a short and
more affordable way to invoke their team's curiosity now corporate hackathons are everywhere from
linkedin to facebook microsoft ebay and yahoo which we will talk about in a second this kind of thinking drives the most
progressive businesses forward but there is one concept that i believe these businesses implicitly understand that i
want to make explicit this is the concept of post-traumatic growth it is the positive psychological
change experienced as a result of adversity and other challenges in order
to rise to a higher level of functioning in short most people who experience a
trauma upwards of 85 percent of them report becoming improved versions of themselves
once they overcome that trauma and i see failure as a trauma firing people is a trauma shifting
directions as a business is a trauma doing hard things is traumatic but we should move towards those traumas
because post-traumatic growth implies that your business will be a better version of itself once it's done
something difficult once it's experienced something traumatic avoiding these traumas
takes you longer to push forward takes you longer to grow striving for failure experimenting in
small batches and obsessing over big problems is the way for your business to get better quicker
and then you need to think long term and to help us move forward on this i want to quote brian chesky the founder
of airbnb and the current ceo he said the company is 13 years old you don't raise your 13 year old to be a good 14
year old you raise your 13 year old to be a great adult with a long career over many
decades brian and his team understand that you need to plan in decades
you need to think in years work in the months and live in the days that move you towards change and action
a company that struggles with this is yahoo we all know them we've probably all had an email address
or searched one of their search engines back in the day but here's a not so well summary
well-known summary of their last 20 years of short-term thinking in 1998 yahoo refused to buy google for
a million dollars in 2002 four years later yahoo was in talks to buy them again but google
wanted more money yahoo refused the offer short-term thinking and that didn't end so well for them
in 2006 another four years later yahoo wanted to buy facebook for a billion but facebook backed out of the deal and
yahoo didn't pursue in 2008 microsoft offered to buy yahoo for a whopping 44.6
billion dollars but yahoo refused and in 2016 verizon finally bought yahoo
for 4.8 billion dollars short-term legacy thinking got in their
way another company that understands legacy thinking blackberry how does a company go from a
profit of 1.9 billion dollars to a massive 5.8 billion deficit within five
years well let me quote the ceo larry conley he said the iphone wasn't secure
it had rapid battery drain and it had a lousy digital keyboard
blackberry suffered from short-term legacy thinking again they weren't thinking about what the market was going to look like in 10
years they were obsessing over their present-day dominance and defending that lead
short-term thinking short-term profit that ended their business in a very short term
a company like patagonia however fundamentally understands the nature of long-term thinking
in 2016 they made over 10 million dollars in their black friday sale and immediately donated it towards saving
the environment they called it their fundraiser for the earth businesses like patagonia they
understand fundamentally how to be curious and to do counter-intuitive things that provide long-term loyalty
and value to their teams and their customers for example they provide free repairs on
some of their items so that you don't go and buy multiple they don't want you to damage the planet they don't want you to make them richer
than they are they want you to be conscious and aware let my people go surfing is the title of
their employee handbook they care about their team so much that when at the head office surf is up
if you do not let your team go surfing you're in trouble they want you to experience a full and
well-rounded life they don't want you to be burned out they don't want you to work 20 hours a day as a default way of
working they buy their loyalty by being loyal to their teams and their customers and
thinking about the future of our planet a more capitalistic approach to this long-term view is amazon
amazon fundamentally understood that low margins led them to have market share
which meant that they could own the market and increase their margins and then dominate and jeff bezos's
massive personal wealth says that he was probably right amazon understands the idea that taking
a short-term hit can provide long-term value and for whatever reason from day one bezos
understood that his shareholders needed to buy into this and they did for decades the shareholders put up with
low dividends small margins and massive growth so that they could dominate the market in the
present day the road to innovation is paved with curiosity and i want to summarize so
that we can understand how to get there as an organization first you need to create a learning culture within your
organization then you need to let your teams obsess over the big problems making sure that
you work with the best people at every possible opportunity you have to start with small experiments
that don't break your business and are not catastrophic if they don't work out and then you need to reframe failure as
a learning experience that your team should strive for and not avoid and finally you need to let your people
think long term and then i want you to do two things
very specifically when you leave this conference today when you are hiring or promoting ask the
person sitting in front of you what are you curious about that is unrelated to work what are you obsessing over that
you can't get out of your head remember it's the smashing together of unexpected things that make interesting people
interested and then secondly in your stand-ups in your weekly team
meetings make curiosity a conscious practice every day
ask each other what you are curious about practice a little bit of curiosity
every single day and then go out and be curious about your lives
thank you so much for your time today i look forward to your questions
