My name is Nic Haralambous and I am a
recovering digital addict and an
entrepreneur. I've been connected to the
internet since I taught myself to code
at the age of 11 years old. That is 30
years of being connected. So in this
talk today, I want to show you how
important it is to stay connected to the
world, to your work, to the internet,
but to not become consumed by it. You'll
leave this talk with a simple system to
help you recognize and use the agency
you have and spark a curiosity that will
drive change in your life. So, let's get
into
it. This guy is what I used to look
like. I used to have a happy, smiling,
full head of hair kind of guy who
thought that he was in control of his
work, in control of his life, and in
control of his mind. Flash forward, I
was incredibly wrong and woefully
incorrect. And I'm going to cut right to
the chase because we don't have a lot of
time together. This young idiot believed
that social media was good for his
mental health. This young idiot believed
that email was his job, that constant
communication via messages worked, and
multitasking was the only way to get
things done. In case you hadn't noticed,
I don't look the same. And I'm not that
young idiot. I also don't like how I
used to work. So, I've spent a decade
trying to get to grips with technology,
how it impacts my day, my life, my work,
my ambitions, my mental health. And
today, I want to unpack a few things
that I've learned over the
years. I bet many of you can relate to
this image of broken leg. You wake up
feeling disjointed, distracted, and
already behind your day before your feet
hit the floor and you get out of bed.
When I had hair and was in my early 20s,
I was building startups, raising venture
capital, and working myself to the bone.
I was suffering from what I call the
sacrifice fallacy. The idea that you
have to sacrifice yourself, your mental
health, and your physical health to be
excellent at your job. When the truth is
the complete opposite, the healthier you
are, the happier you are as a human
being, the better your work will be.
This is what happens when you buy into
the sacrifice fallacy and the social
media rubbish you read all the time. You
end up with insomnia, chronic stress,
kidney stones, a stomach ulcer, constant
headaches, depression, anxiety, and
finally a lot of anger, rage, and
aggression towards your situation. How
do I know all of this? Because I've had
all of these things that you see. When I
was building one of my startups in my
20s, I was woken up at 2 a.m. with a
shooting pain in my gut. I thought it
was the recent kidney stones that had
just passed twice or something related
to that. But I was wrong. I was alone in
my apartment and I knew that something
was wrong. I was in very big trouble. So
I got in my car, hunched over, and I
drove myself to the emergency room
yelling out in pain the entire 20-minute
drive there. This is the sort of
physical trauma you can expect and is
brought on by believing things like
this. Reed Hoffman, the original post,
he is the LinkedIn founder and he
believes that balance is a sign of
impending failure. He says, "If a
founder brags about having a balanced
life, I assume they're not serious about
winning." And this is why I love X so
much because Jason, the founder of Base
Camp, he replied and said, "This is so
exploitive, stupid. He believes that the
idea of winning at all costs is stupid."
So, let me ask you, how do you feel
about this? How do you think your
managers or leaders think about this
idea? I think that this is a false
dichotomy to begin with, presenting only
two viable answers. You either find
balance and you lose at career or you
don't find balance and you lose at your
life. I think that first we need to ask
ourselves what winning looks like. Is
your life separate from your career and
I don't mean what other people think
winning looks like. What is your idea of
success? Does it align to the work that
you're doing? Does it align to the
friends that you have, your hobbies,
your family? Have you even communicated
this version of success to your
colleagues and managers or partners at
home? So now remember that pain in my
stomach. It turns out I had a stress
induced stomach ulcer that hospitalized
me for days. So where does the stress
even begin? I'll bet that much like me,
your anxiety and stress seeps into your
bones as soon as you wake up in the
morning. There is a cascade of
reactionary behavior that I want to
highlight here. Think about your morning
this morning. Your alarm went off and
you did what? What I did was unlock my
phone so that I can switch off the
alarm. And just unlocking your phone is
an act of violence against your day,
your mental health, and your chance of
getting ahead in your day. Simply
unlocking your phone sends a cascade of
notifications, social media checks,
who's liked your photo, your video, who
said what to whom on what platform and
where. You start in react mode. You
start to react in your mind and your
gut. You feel that addictive hold of
your phone pulling your attention and
then the inevitable happens. You check
your email. You check your Slack. You
check your calendar. You see your
deadlines and the panic starts rising.
It's over for us already. The second
you've checked your calendar, you've
officially entered React
mode. So, here's the thing. You're not
broken because you activate React mode
right out of the gates. You just happen
to live in a system that profits from
your attention. And nobody has pointed
that out to you yet. So, let me
notifications are designed by other
human beings who want you to open their
app more every day. Why? because their
KPI for the quarter is active daily
users. Email is someone else's to-do
list for your day and it's a company
endorsed distraction. Slack and Teams
are designed to make you look responsive
and productive while keeping you deeply
reactive and not doing anything. The
pull of multitasking is killing your
productivity. Gloria Marx's research
showed that it takes 23 minutes to
refocus after switching tasks. The
American Psychological Association found
that multitasking causes a 40%
productivity loss. These systems prevent
you from focusing on your actual job and
the work you find
meaningful. So, let me say this clearly.
You are not bad at focus. You're just
being interrupted all the time.
You don't need more time to do the
thing. You need more intention to get
the thing done. You're trapped in a
system of reaction and busy work rather
than producing successful
outcomes. So, how do you actually
produce successful outcomes? How do you
break the
cycle? How do you find out what to work
on and help yourself achieve those
goals? Well, today I want to present a
framework to you with four key concepts
to help you gain control of your
attention and stay connected to the work
that really matters. Over the next few
minutes, as I move through this
framework to identify, I want you to
pick one single area where you are
struggling the most and try to improve
on that one. Okay? So, let's go. First,
what I need you to do is
decide. Then, I need you to be
intentional. Then I need you to
act and loop back. So decide what
matters today. Be intentional about your
focus. Act using your agency and close
the loop so you can reflect and learn.
This is my dial framework. Decide intend
act loop. Because in a world of constant
noise and digital pull, you don't need
more time. You need better signal and
you need a deadline. This system turns
attention management into a conscious
ritual by turning a dial each day to the
signal that matters the most to
you. When you don't
decide, you default. I'm going to say
that again because I think it's
important. When you don't make an active
decision, you default to the habits you
have. And the default mode in modern
work is reactive and noisy. In the name
of destroying multitasking each day, you
need to decide what is the single most
important thing you need to work on. And
if you can't decide what that most
important thing is, then you need to go
back one step and understand how you're
being judged in your job, what success
means to you, and how you need to
achieve the success in your job. Here
I'd like to talk about high agency. I am
very bullish on the concept of owning
your own high agency. High agency people
decide what work they do. They own the
outcomes and they find practical
solutions forward. But what is high
agency? How do you even recognize it
when you see it? Well, this is August
Lesser refusing to salute at a Nazi
rally in
Hamburg. That is high agency but high
stakes. And I'll give you a quick
scenario here. If one day you find
yourself in South America doing
something silly and by accident getting
arrested and now you're in a prison in
South America, you have one phone call
to phone somebody who can get you out of
that prison. Who do you call? Think
about that for a second. That person has
high agency. You recognize high agency
in them. So think about that person.
Now, we're obviously not all playing
such high stakes game all the time, but
there have been meetings that you've sat
in where you could have or should have
said something, but you didn't. That's
low agency. Today is the day you shift
to become a high agency person and
improve your life. So, let me say this
again as clearly as I can for the third
time. Email is not your job. Responding
to Slack is not your job. Multitasking
is bad for your job. These systems
remove your agency. This one word,
agency, is going to change how you
experience your job. You have agency.
It's given to most of us. You've just
forgotten about it or forgotten to use
it. This is my high agency work spectrum
which I've adapted from George Max work.
If you are in a rocking team and you're
surrounded by eight players and you find
yourself in a space where things are
moving even if you aren't moving
them, then work is happening to you, but
you are not happening to work. If you
were sitting in this keynote today and
you feel stuck with nothing to show for
your first five months of 2025 and you
feel like you're surrounded by B
players, then work isn't happening to
you and you are not happening to work.
That is probably the worst place to be
right now. You could also be the best
person in your entire division, but the
overall division is slowing down,
suffering, and in decline. Not great,
but at least you are happening to work
and it's showing. Now, the final
quadrant is where high agency players
live. Here you attract the best projects
and the best people, and you are all
firing on all cylinders all the time.
You are happening to work and work is
happening to you. Now, I'd like you to
take a second and consider where you
honestly believe you sit in these
quadrants. Cool. Now, one quick example
of decision-m at base camp. It's a
remote first company that operates in
six week cycles. Before each cycle,
everyone in the company decides what to
build for the next six week cycle and
then everything else is off the table
for that period. The outcome has been
amazing. Basec camp reports more focus,
less scope creep, greater product
quality. So remember, deciding what not
to do is just as powerful as deciding
what to focus on. So before you check
your email, before you read your Slack,
I want you to write down one line in
your day every morning. And that line is
today is about what? Today is about
closing out that project, answering
emails, whatever it might
be. So deciding what matters is
powerful, but intention is what protects
it. Intent is the bridge between what
you've decided you need to work on and
the action. Without intent, decisions
drown in distractions and reactions.
The average knowledge worker is
interrupted every 6 to 12
minutes. Be honest, we're about 10
minutes into this talk. How many of you
have looked at your phone, picked to
another tab, changed and your focus, and
looked at something else? I bet you more
than just
one. Look, meetings can also easily
become distractions as you bounce from
one to the other with no time to
actually do your work. Let me be clear.
Meetings are not my job. I used to
believe that they were my job. But
meetings are not your job either. You
have to own your calendar. Own your
time. And don't let other people decide
what's important in your day. That's
kind of what a meeting is. Remember
again, notifications, emails, they're
not your job. They're other people's
plan for what your day should look like.
Say that again. It's really important.
notifications, emails, and meetings are
other people's plans for your day if you
don't set intention first. So, you need
to intentionally protect your time. And
here's the thing I want you to do. Just
block out 90 minutes every day in your
calendar for deep work. That's it. You
have to be able to carve out that time.
Over time, I've even managed to carve
out two full days in my calendar with no
meetings, if you can believe that. If
you're aimlessly working on things just
to look busy, then you're going to
context switch. You're going to
multitask. You're going to look at the
emails. You're going to look at the
notifications and you will do no real
work and move forward at all. In 2021,
Dropbox shifted to a virtual first
model, rethinking how teams collaborate
without defaulting to meetings or
synchronous work. The company
implemented a core collaboration hour.
This was defined windows when employees
are expected to be available for live
meetings and communication. Outside of
these hours, deep work is encouraged and
meetings are discouraged. Teams gained
more flexibility and control over their
attention. Focus was protected by
design. And an exercise I think that
everyone should do at some point in
their career is observe when you do your
best work. This plays into the final
part of the dial framework. Do you know
at all when your best time of work is?
When you're the most creative, when
you're the most focused? If you don't, I
urge you to try and figure that out.
Figure this out and then take a page out
of Dropbox book and take control of how
you communicate with your team and your
colleagues. Tell them what to expect
from you. Tell them when to message you.
Tell them when your blocks of time are
for deep work. And then it gives you the
space to act on the important asks. And
this takes us to the final part of the
dial framework, which is to act. You've
decided what counts. You've set your
intentions. You're aware of the agency
that you have to do the thing. And
acting is where you move from focus
protection to meaningful progress. This
is about doing the thing, not just
feeling
productive. When Elon Musk, love him or
hate him, bought Twitter, he now
famously asked the CEO at the time,
"What have you done this week?"
Never have five or six words been so
scary to a CEO when a new acquirer asks
you, "What have you done this week?" And
I bet you if you're sitting here and
listening to me ask this question and
you've got a knot in your stomach,
that's because you've done very little
this week. You should be fearful of that
question. If you don't know what you're
working on, if you haven't set time
aside to do that work, and if you aren't
acting with agency, you won't know what
to
do. So, this question you need to be
able to answer at the end of the week.
And conversely, this starts you working
on the correct thing in the following
week. So, if intention is the map,
action is the path forward. But you
can't get anywhere by staring at the
map. You have to actually start acting.
You have to get in the car and drive. Go
on the street and
walk. To illustrate this point, I want
you to meet somebody that you will never
have heard of, but did something pretty
amazing in South Africa. This is Mosana
Makate. He was a junior accountant at
Vodafone South Africa. When he had an
insight one day many years ago, he
realized that millions of mobile users
in South Africa, particularly in
lowincome communities, often didn't have
airtime to make calls. Yet, they still
needed to communicate with people on
their phones. So, Mate had a simple
idea. He wanted to leverage a free
message from person without airtime to
somebody else called a please call me.
The action was really simple. He pitched
this to his superiors. He didn't go to
the product team. He went to his
superior in the accounting department.
He then collaborated with internal teams
and the feature was rolled out with a
short code that allowed users to send a
please call me message at no cost to
them with an adverts attached to the end
of the message to monetize the message
making free messages profitable. Please
call me became one of the most widely
used mobile features in the country. And
after a decadel long legal battle, Mate
eventually won the court case to be
compensated for his work and made a lot
of
money. So there's a huge part of
improving and gaining control of your
life that most people just ignore.
That's the loop. Once you've decided
what matters, you've set your intention,
you've successfully acted, now you need
to stop and learn what worked. Building
feedback loops into your life makes
growth easier. You need to loop back
around on your decisions and see if they
worked or not. I've made it a personal
hobby to experiment with my life. How
much sleep I get, what food I eat, which
work makes me happy and sad, how
exercise affects my outcomes. It's all
about experimenting and learning. For
me, and there are two actions that I
want to promote today that I believe
will help you also begin to constantly
learn. The first is I am obsessively
curious about everything that I do in my
life. Why did one thing work and another
didn't? Why was this day good in the
office but that day bad? Why did I get
more work done here and not work done
there? Why was meeting A successful and
meeting B wasn't? I don't wait other
people to figure this out for me. I use
my agency and I ask questions all the
time in every scenario. I'm the guy who
doesn't mind looking stupid in meetings
to ask the dumb question.
Curiosity is the engine of insight. I'm
going to say that again. Curiosity is
the engine you need to use for your
insights. The more curious you are about
the work you do, the reasons you
succeed, the types of social media you
watch, the feeds that you browse, your
intentionality around the tools that
you're using, your screens, the more
curious you are about those things, the
better you will
become. And the last point is going to
be extremely uncomfortable for most of
you. We are constantly on our phones or
watching series or YouTube or checking
email or Slack or streaming Twitch or
flipping through Tik Tok or on the Insta
Talk feed. I don't know anymore what the
young people do when we actually just
need to sit down and be
bored. Yes, you heard that right. You
read that right. Boredom can be a
catalyst for change in your life.
Contrary to the negative connotation,
boredom can be a powerful catalyst for
creativity and problem solving. Boredom
allows the mind to wonder during periods
of low stimulation and that can lead to
innovative ideas and solutions to your
problems. And if you don't believe me,
journalist Manush Samaroi conducted a
week-long experiment with 20,000
participants encouraging them to reduce
digital distractions and embrace
boredom. The result participants
reported increased creativity,
productivity, and self-reflection. And
Zamarodi explains that when we allow our
minds to wonder, activating the brain's
default mode, we engage in what is
called autobiographical planning and
problem solving. You start planning your
own life, your own progress, your own
trajectory forward and the work that you
do. And this leads to lots of innovative
ideas. We constantly try to fill every
second with a distraction when our minds
are begging us for periods of low
stimulation so we can process what we've
learned and experienced and do something
different at the
end. So today I've pointed out some
really simple problems with how we work.
I'm going to go over them quickly. The
sacrifice fallacy. Giving up your own
health to achieve your career goals.
trying to achieve someone else's version
of success without understanding what
yours is. Meetings that don't move
metrics, multitasking that's killing
your productivity, notifications that
should be turned off, distractions that
destroy your focus, and the way to break
the shackles of these simple hells. Just
dial
in. Just decide what matters most in
your day, your week. Be intentional with
your time. less reactive in your day.
Act with your own agency and do fewer
things better. And then loop back on
your success and failure to learn what
works. And remember, all I ask for you
is to figure out which one of these you
are struggling with at the moment and
work on that in the coming weeks. Thank
you all so much and don't forget to turn
the dial up on your
