# Prologue

Building things is hard. Building a business is extremely hard. It’s meant to be hard. Its being hard means that most people will not build a business of their own and that’s absolutely fine. Not everyone is a founder or an entrepreneur. Without people to work in businesses entrepreneurs would not be able to scale their life’s work.   
In my life, living has meant doing. I’ve always done things very proactively. I’ve always aspired to do more and more things. I can’t imagine a life without doing. That means that a lot of my time has been spent failing. When you start out doing something you generally aren’t very good at it. Most people will drift towards something that they are kind of good at or can do with some level of competence. They’ll do that thing until they become good enough to be paid to do it. Then they stop trying to do anything new or different. They stop doing more. They stop trying to get better and therefore stop failing. I’ve never really had it in me to stop trying to get better and stop learning. I always want to do more.   
Failure is an integral part of learning. Unfortunately the world today believes that failing is bad and as a result we have, on the whole, become fearful of failure. I’ve spent my life embracing failure, indulging the experience, basking in the frustration and despondence that failure brings. I’ve discovered through lots of doing and failing that this is the best way for me to learn and improve. I do, then I fail, then I learn. The more I do the more I learn. Sure that comes with a significant amount of failure in amongst it all, but what’s a little pain to achieve a little gain?  
The learning part is definitely the most complicated part of my building process. It’s easy to fail and then slump into a depression and forget that there is a lesson in there somewhere. It’s easy to fail, trust me, I’ve done it a lot. In fact it’s probably the thing that I am most successful at. What happens with most people who are building is that they will fail and then feel like a failure. It’s feeling like a failure that makes most people want to stop doing and stop learning. There’s a difference between failing and feeling like a failure and I think that learning is that difference. When you learn through a failure you have not failed. You’ve learned how not to do something. You’ve learned a new way to not solve the problem you are working on. There are many versions of the famous Thomas Edison quote about inventing the light bulb and his views on failure, I like this one the most: *‘I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.’*  
This is not a book about how you can make millions of dollars. This isn’t even a book about how I made millions of dollars. I don’t have millions of dollars in cold hard cash in my bank account. Not yet. This is a book filled with lessons. Lessons that I have learned over many businesses, many failures and from many different people.   
This is a book about starting something and failing a lot. This is a book about relationships, people, networking, loss, and all the other things that come with starting a business and building something that has meaning.  
The past is remembered in different ways by different people. The same moment in time can be seen and retold in myriad ways. What follows is my experience of the things that I have done and how I remember doing them. Those who did them with me may have a different view and that’s fine. That’s their story to tell. This is mine.   
Starting a business has not made me a happy person. Many would argue that it has done the opposite. But starting a business has made me feel more alive than anything I’ve ever done. I don’t know how to live another kind of life any more. Starting a business has given me incredible insight into the way I live my life, the choices I make and the systems I use to engage with the world. My goal is to tell you about my experiences and the lessons I’ve learned through doing. These are not only lessons for entrepreneurs. These are lessons for anyone who wants to rethink and reframe the way they exist in the world and live their lives. Right now you might be building something without even realising it. Really think about it right now. Are you building a career, a reputation, a family, a skill set or maybe a team? If so, then you might need to shake things up, rethink and reframe the way you are building.  
Over the past 15 years I have experienced mental instability, depression, paranoia, joy, sadness, confusion, elation, frustration, physical sickness brought on by stress, strained relationships and everything in between.   
If you are thinking about starting a business or a new project or you are currently running one right now then this is a book for you. This book is meant to help you understand that everyone running a business or doing something new feels like you do. Everyone running a business is scared that they aren’t good enough, scared that they will fail, scared that they may not be able to pay salaries at the end of the month, scared that the success they have found will be lost along the way. Everyone is drowning in the thoughts that they may not be good enough.   
It’s taken me many years to be able to talk about my experiences without trying to make them sound better to pump up my ego and make myself feel OK about my shortcomings. It makes me happy to be honest with people, to build things, to learn things and to fail. Success is a nice by-product if you can get it, but it is most certainly not guaranteed and not where you should derive your joy or self-worth. In fact, if you want to be successful and happy then you probably shouldn’t start a business. You should get a job and work in someone else’s business. Let them suffer the burden and the turmoil. But you also risk giving them the glory and freedom if they make it. Sure, it is a risk but one that I don’t know how to live without. This is all I know how to do now.  
Each of my businesses has taught me something specific that has changed the way I experience the world. I’m writing this book with the hope that when you read it you will understand that you can build businesses, your new home, your new family, a team, a project at work or absolutely anything if you want to.   
There is no universal piece of advice that everyone can adopt. All I can tell you is the following: 

***Do. Fail. Learn. Repeat.***

Every business that I have ever started began with me believing that I would succeed. They all started with me thinking that I knew what I was in for. They all started with a very clear goal in mind and a destination that I was aiming to arrive at. Unfortunately things very rarely work out the way I plan.   
Starting a business will not make you happy. Starting a business is statistically not going to make you wealthy. I’d go so far as to say that starting a business is probably going to make you fat, sick, mentally unstable and broke. And that’s just the good parts.    
Do you want to know why you have never heard this type of honesty from other entrepreneurs? Because of ego. Most entrepreneurs want you to think that everything is amazing, that they’re smashing it out of the park, that their investors love them, their customers are paying them all of the monies and it’s easy and fun on their side of life. They want you to join the club of insanity. For years I’ve said that almost every entrepreneur I know is a little bit broken. I mean that quite literally. I think that you need to have at least one major screw loose in your brain to want to put yourself through the ups and downs that are inevitable when you are building something that matters.  
I can’t tell you how to be a better entrepreneur, build a better business or find a short cut to success. There are no short cuts. There is nothing simple and if you find that it is simple, it’s probably wrong. The really brilliant, simple and elegant solutions require fucking hard work and drive to execute properly and make successful. There are some entrepreneurs who claim that their journey has been simple and fun all the way through. I call that bullshit. There are so many people trying to look cool, feel good and pump up their egos that I simply don’t trust what people say any more.  
You don’t have to trust what I say either.  
I’m not trying to help you build a billion dollar business. I just want to tell you about a few businesses that I have built over the years and you can take what you need from my experiences. The lessons I’ve learned may not apply directly to you. You might disagree with some of what I have to say and that’s absolutely OK with me. This is the system that has worked for me. These are the processes that make me feel like I’m doing, learning, failing, living and doing again. You don’t have to copy my system exactly; you can take what you like and leave the rest.  
My entire life I have struggled with Impostor Phenomenon. If you’re not familiar with Impostor Phenomenon, then I’m about to change your life. Have you ever thought to yourself ‘I just got lucky’ or ‘I feel like a fake’? Then you have experienced Impostor Phenomenon. Impostor Phenomenon (also commonly known as Impostor Syndrome) is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalise their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud’. Read that definition again and let it sink in, I’ll wait.  
Let me break it down further. You know that feeling when you walk into a room and think you’re the least qualified to be there? Everyone in the room is probably having that same feeling. We all feel like a fraud. This single feeling has plagued me for my entire conscious life and driven me to be better throughout my entire career. I still go into meetings today and feel like I don’t belong. If we meet, that’s what I’m thinking. I make a point of surrounding myself with the best people I can find (more on that later) and this makes me feel constantly uncomfortable and fills me with a constant need to be better.   
The term ‘impostor syndrome’ first appeared in an article written by Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes in 1978 who observed many high-achieving women tended to believe they were not intelligent, and that they were over-evaluated by others. For many years researchers believed that impostor syndrome was concentrated in high-performing women, but as the research grew it was discovered that both men and women experience feeling like a fraud. I prefer to call the experience Impostor Phenomenon because I don’t believe that I suffer from this feeling or experience. I believe it helps me push myself to be better and learn more so that I stay on top of things. It’s a phenomenon in my life, not a syndrome.  
People like Elon Musk, Richard Branson and countless others (every entrepreneur I’ve ever met) have openly admitted to struggling with this feeling. It’s everywhere. It doesn’t mean you should stop trying and give in to the feeling of inadequacy. It doesn’t have to be a syndrome in your life, it can be a phenomenon that makes you better.   
I spent the first half of my entrepreneurial journey feeling like an impostor. I spent the next short part trying to prove that I was not an impostor and in the most recent years of building businesses I have just stopped caring for the most part.  
Struggling with Impostor Phenomenon and then trying to write a book about building businesses, and mostly failing, is a really contradictory thing to do. So I’m dealing with some stuff as I write these words. Bear with me because this is how I process and this is the best way that I know to get across the truth about building things.   
There is no business too big or too small to start. There is no right time to let it happen. If you’re reading this book with an idea in your head or a business plan waiting to be sent out into the world then you need to read on with intent. The stories ahead will talk about timing, partnerships, investment and many other things that you need to know about to start a business. The funny thing is that I knew very little about almost all of them when I started building businesses. In fact, I continue to learn something new every day. If there’s one thing that I can attribute my drive and hunger to it is a growing curiosity. I am curious about everything. Read this book and grow your curiosity as you do so. Don’t let the world happen to you. Live, don’t just breathe.

## **THE THING ABOUT FAILURE**

It’s important for me to begin this book by discussing the concept of failure. Without failure I would be lost in the world. Failure is one of the most misunderstood and misused experiences around. I talk a lot about my failures. It hasn’t always been easy to discuss the things that have gone badly for me because when I was younger failure would dent my fragile ego. Early on in life I hated failing. I feared failure as if it was death knocking at my door. I would do anything and everything to avoid failing. I remember being in high school and sitting in the car on a Tuesday morning on the way into school and realising that I was woefully underprepared for a test (a pretty irrelevant test) and spinning out into a panic. I could not cope with the idea that I might fail. It broke me.  
I think that this is how most people feel about failure throughout their lives.   
For most people failure is something to be feared. That’s absolute bullshit. I have realised that failure is something that I need to seek out and strive for.   
This simple reframing of failure has changed my life forever. It wasn’t something that happened overnight. I’ve had to suffer many setbacks and learn many hard lessons to understand that there’s no way to go forward and build something amazing without making mistakes along the way. One of the failures that I remember distinctly was my mid-year matric exams. These were the big ones for university applications. These mid-year exams meant everything for young South Africans trying to build a future. I failed my mid-year exams. I failed my exams because I had reached a point where I didn’t give a shit. I had a full plate in my final year of high school and decided that these exams were the breaking point for me. I was the head boy of my school. I played first team rugby. I was in the top academic classes for the key subjects and everything was going my way. But the night before my exams my parents told me that they were getting divorced. This was not a shock to me at all because they were happier apart than together but something clicked in my brain. I didn’t care about my exams and I was going to blame my parents when I failed.   
That’s exactly what I did and exactly what happened. I did not study. I did not write much in the exams. I tried but with very little intent. Ultimately I failed most of my exams.   
Here’s the thing – I had spent 11 years working to create a successful school career and failing these exams did not prevent me from getting into the university of my choice and following my plans. Failing had made my life immeasurably more difficult but the world did not end. At 18 years old I failed the biggest test of my short life but I realised that my future was not over. This lesson stuck with me. There is very little that you can fuck up that ends your life. If we are all honest about the world in which we live, the only failure that you should not want is the one that ends with you dying. If you aren’t dying, you aren’t really failing. You’re just adding to your list of learnings. When you fail you’re just figuring out how your life works. Every time I’ve failed since then I’ve been adding to the list of things that I know don’t work for me, or didn’t work in the way that I did them the first time.   
Failure is not the end of something but the beginning of something else. I’ve spent my life building things, failing, figuring out the lessons from the failure and then doing something slightly (or completely) different to see if the outcome is different or the same. If the outcome is the same – another failure – then I tweak it again. Failure is this weird swear word that we all give too much power to and try to avoid using or admitting to. The less we experience it, the less we talk about it, the more power it has over us and those around us. I’ve made it my goal to consistently and honestly discuss the things that I’ve fucked up. I’ve noticed the most amazing thing: the more I talk about my own failures, the more other people feel comfortable to talk about their screw-ups. I learn so much from hearing about how other people have done things, failed and learned that it inspires me to try again and do more.   
This book is the chronological telling of my own failures, lessons and attempts at building meaningful things. I urge you to start embracing failure and the lessons that come with failing and then I beg you to talk more openly and with less ego about your failures.

## **WHERE YOU COME FROM – WHERE YOU’RE GOING**

I was one of those kids who thought that he knew better than his parents. I never took their lessons seriously, I never acknowledged that their experience was not only valid but valuable. It’s important to distinguish between a valid and a valuable experience. Everyone has an experience of the world that is valid. It is theirs and they experience the world in that way. That makes it valid to them. It may not be valuable to me because I experience the world in a different way, but I can’t deny that my father experienced his life in a way that was unique to him. Not everyone’s valid experiences are valuable to me.   
My family had many valuable experiences that I chose to ignore and believe were not like my experience of the world. I wish I had paid closer attention to them and their lessons. I wish I had been more engaged in conversations with my grandparents when they were alive. I wish that I had been more curious when I was younger. But I think this is part of the curse of being young and invincible; I believed that no one understood my experience of the world or could help me become better. Least of all my parents.   
Having said that, over time you notice that the things your parents once told you actually start to make sense and the lessons they provided become more relevant and useful. I learned from my grandfather, uncle, mother and father that you need to be resilient to survive. You will absolutely fail. There is no question that if you take the leap to start something, you will fail at some point. If you choose to start over or continue, then you’re resilient and you’ll probably be OK. 

I was born into a family of South African Greeks who collectively had very little formal or traditional education past high school. My mom and dad both finished high school and are both extremely intelligent and resourceful people, but they are not academic. They are hustlers and I suppose that’s where I get it from.  
My grandfather moved from Cyprus to South Africa fleeing an invasion by the Turks. He gave up his British passport for a South African one and arrived with his young wife. They were betrothed so she had no real choice in the matter. When they landed in South Africa, they did not follow the trend and head into a city centre or to the coast, they went to Welkom. Yup, they moved to a place called Welkom, in the Free State. There are many jokes about Greeks but the most common and accurate one is actually true. What does the Greek football team do when they get a corner in a game? They open up a café.   
We like to open up corner cafés. That’s our jam. That’s our default. That’s what we revert back to in times of trouble and uncertainty. When my grandfather arrived in South Africa, that’s what he did. He opened a café that supplied the town with things like bread, milk, cheese and any other basics people required. My grandfather used to say: ‘You can buy bread, you can buy cheese, but you cannot buy experience.’ He should know; he sold bread and cheese and I’ll bet back then if he figured out how to sell experience he would have.  
This is also what my father and uncle have done when they met with hard times. Open a corner café. My father tells me that he and my uncle had a company that was thriving in the late 1980s and early 90s called Quorum. It was a listed entity and did exceedingly well. I remember driving in my uncle’s Ferrari when I was a kid. That’s all I remember of that period in my life: money. We had lots of it, and then we had little. And then we had a lot again, and then we had a little. It was confusing. My dad went from driving fancy cars and splurging on nice things to being a depressed and deflated man sitting on the couch with no prospects and what appeared to be a broken heart. I didn’t understand at the time that he was going through a real loss. I also didn’t realise that I would go through a few of these real and heartbreaking business losses in the years to come. If only I had paid more attention.  
No matter what my parents went through, they always made sure that I had enough. They always found a way to make it work. They always gave me a birthday present, always paid my school fees and they always managed to feed me and put clothes on my back. They were and are successful people by any definition of the word. But neither of my parents found a vocation. Neither of them had the luxury to take the time to discover their true calling, that thing that makes them content and gets them up in the morning. It didn’t seem to hold them back though. They owned restaurants, my father was once a fantastic chef who trained in top hotels in Johannesburg; he has worked in finance; owned the obligatory corner café, a paint shop and a car radio installation centre, amongst many other ventures. My mother has worked at car companies, finance businesses, selling property all over the world and even sold luxury socks when she worked for me at one of my businesses.   
They both taught me one of the most important entrepreneurial lessons of my life: *resilience*. 

As hard as my parents tried, they were unable to dissuade me from the life of an entrepreneur. My dad in particular tried extremely hard to get me to become a professional with a stable career. He wanted me to do anything other than own a business. Over the years I’ve looked back and have held a lot of frustration towards my dad for not embracing the entrepreneurial path as a more viable one for his son but he was doing the best he could. The grass is always greener and my dad wanted me to have the most lush lawn in the world.   
I could have been a doctor, lawyer, accountant, any of these, and he would have been content. Unfortunately for my dad, I believe that I was born to be an entrepreneur. I don’t believe that everyone has it in them to be an entrepreneur. I believe that entrepreneurs exist in the same way that gifted athletes exist. They have a sense that there is an innate gift that they have and they set out to nurture it throughout their lives. Entrepreneurs build, fail, learn and do. Yeah, sure, there are lots of people who own businesses and people who buy and sell things who probably don’t care too much about their business or lives as entrepreneurs. But I think that true entrepreneurship is something you simply can’t live without. It’s an addiction, a desire, a drug that you get into and it consumes all of you.  
In my experience, entrepreneurs are all kinds of broken. If you understand this as a fundamental then you will have a much better chance of understanding anyone building a business. We are broken. I don’t think there are any exceptions. In one way or another there is something we are trying to fix, fill, understand, come to terms with or battle.  
Once I understood that I was broken and that I came from a long line of broken people, my journey became a lot more enjoyable. The pain doesn’t go away, the turmoil never leaves and it definitely doesn’t get easier the more you do it. The problems become more complex and the goals become more ambitious so it rarely gets easier.  
I wouldn’t want it any other way. This shit is hard and it’s meant to be.  
I am often asked what I believe it truly takes to be an entrepreneur. Is there a single trait that defines the best from everyone else?  
It’s not a simple answer but if I had to pick one thing, I believe that resilience is the single trait that has separated me from my peers or my competition. The best entrepreneurs I know didn’t have the best ideas, the best teams or the most money. They persisted and survived for longer with less than anyone else. They were alive for long enough to succeed.  
Paul Graham is a programmer, investor and writer. In 2005 he and Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell started Y Combinator, the first of a new type of startup incubator. Since 2005 Y Combinator has funded over a thousand startups, including Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. Paul wrote a fantastic essay that I read regularly called ‘How Not to Die’. Here’s an excerpt: 

*If you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it’s actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.*  
*It was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.*

Just avoid dying. Repeat that with me: Just. Avoid. Dying.   
It’s incredible how often I talk with other entrepreneurs who are not willing to do what it takes to make their businesses survive. Some claim that they will do whatever it takes, I had a business partner who believed that dearly until crunch time came, but I’ll get to that later.   
For now, if you want to know what it takes to make it then look no further than resilience.   
There are very, very few businesses that are literal overnight successes.   
Here are a few businesses that I admire and their ages (in 2018): 

Hermès – 180 years old  
Ford Motor Company – 114 years old  
Ferrari – 78 years old  
Starbucks – 46 years old  
Versace – 39 years old  
Amazon – 23 years old  
Facebook – 13 years old

Even the sprightly Facebook is more than a decade old.   
Take a moment now to think about the business you currently own, your side hustle or the project you are working on at your job. How long have you been working on it? More than a year? Less than ten? I have been building my business NicHarry.com for five years and I believe we’re just a little baby that hasn’t yet figured out how to talk properly or run.  
It may be popular today to brag about how quickly a person created their wealth but I am less interested in the creation of someone’s wealth than I am in their story and the knowledge they have gained. Yes, you can make a quick buck building a YouTube channel with every trick and hack in the book and build it up to a point where some brand is paying you a chunk of money to review their products, but will you be able to pivot that into a business? A media company? A series of YouTube channels? Or are you just a personality getting paid per video?  
Or are you a freelancer? I hate to be the one to break it to you, but if you are a freelancer and you have a steady pay cheque coming in working in someone else’s business then you probably aren’t an entrepreneur, you’re a freelancer. And that’s absolutely great. You can be the best freelancer out there, you just aren’t an entrepreneur in my definition of the experience.   
But that doesn’t really matter because if you truly believe you’re an entrepreneur, then who am I to argue?   
What I do know is that there are thousands of entrepreneurs who are sitting at corporate jobs bored out of their minds. If that’s you and you’re reading this book then prepare yourself for the brutal truth on the difficulties you are going to face if you go it alone. If you are not interested in starting your own venture, that’s cool too. You can still engage in your work with the verve of an entrepreneur but I urge you to sit up and take your career seriously, don’t coast by because then you are wasting your talents and ambitions. It’s not binary out there, there are billions of ways to do the things you want to do.

## **MY DAD’S BUSINESSES**

The first recollection that I have of feeling businesslike is visiting my dad’s businesses through the years. He is quite an accomplished entrepreneur. That’s not to say that he’s a rich retiree. He’s accomplished in that he has built many businesses that set up a good life for himself, his wife and his kids. My dad knows how to hustle and how to grind.  
Like many kids around the world, I liked visiting my dad’s work. He was the boss and I always felt good entering the doors of his businesses knowing that it was his (and, by proxy, mine too). The first business that I remember appreciating was called MotorRadio and it pretty much did what it said on the tin: they put radios in motor cars. It was a thriving business and managed to put me through private school and university.  
MotorRadio always seemed so big to me. I was in primary school when my dad and uncle acquired the business. He knew exactly nothing about the car industry, radios, air conditioners in cars or managing a team of people who worked on cars. He was completely in the dark but saw potential in the business and took the gap. He completely faked it. At the time I had no idea that this was the case. When you’re a kid you just assume that your parents know what the fuck they’re doing. From my perspective it worked: we were in school, we had food, we had a nice enough house and two cars. Golden times.   
I hold a lot of latent frustration with my dad when I think about this period of my life. As I’ve mentioned, he wanted me to have a stable career. This meant that he did not include me in his experiences as an entrepreneur. He comes from a generation of people who do not talk about the bad times and lie to people about the good times. Everything is always fine. This meant that I was never exposed to the hardships of his business experiences. I never learned from his incredible experience. I was never brought into the business to understand how it worked and exposed to the guts of his company. I was always on the outside looking in and to this day I hold that against him. But in his defence, he didn’t know there was another way. His job was to provide me with the best education he could and he didn’t understand that his teachings were probably more valuable to me than anything I was learning in school or in a textbook.   
The way that I learn today is a direct result of not being taught about business by my family. I learn through doing, faking it, breaking it and observing my own experiences. My dad could tell me that I should turn left and I’d probably turn right to see what would happen if I ignored him. I was a typical teenager. 

In high school I began spending more time at my dad’s business but not enough to really ignite any kind of entrepreneurial spirit. I would go there on the weekends to get his team to help me with science projects and other random things. I always noticed that the back office of his business was an absolute mess. Papers everywhere, everything splayed all over the show. The only person who seemed to know where anything went or how much cash was in the till was my dad. Even back then I recognised that this is definitely not a good thing. One person can manage only so much.  
My dad would hustle and grind every day, harder than I’ve seen anyone work since. He works harder to this day than I can bring myself to. He was always a gentleman, honest, kind and extremely generous. I remember him coming home every night from work, summer or winter and taking his shoes and socks off, rolling up his denims and putting his feet in the swimming pool. His feet were always ‘on fire’. I could not comprehend this but never really found the nerve to ask him why he was being so weird about his feet. Today I understand intimately that if you are on your feet, serving customers and walking the floor of your workshop for 12 to 14 hours a day, your feet get tired, sore, swollen and hot. His solution was to dunk his feet in the pool every night when he arrived home.   
Sadly, I believe that this hustle is the thing that held my dad back and trapped him in a cycle that he has yet to break out of. He grinds and hustles, he hustles and grinds, he works longer hours, he works harder during those hours and continues with the same grind, unchanged and expecting the results to improve. Unfortunately I don’t believe that your results improve the longer the hours. I don’t think that it’s OK to brag about how late you stayed up working or how tired you are from your all-nighter. This is the old-guard way of approaching business and competition. I believe that you need to prioritise properly in your life and then protect your priorities viciously.   
For example, if you prioritise your kids and they make you happy then you should maintain that priority as long and as often as possible. Get home to bath them, play in the garden and sit at the dinner table. If that’s what success looks like to you, then make that happen. If you prioritise work and you want to work all-nighters and that fulfils you, then that’s cool too.   
My dad’s priority was always his family. He wanted us to have everything he never had. He wanted us to have nice clothes, go to the best schools, go on holidays and have money to buy things we wanted. He thought that the longer he stayed at work, the more money he would make for us but with MotorRadio that was just not the case. Nothing that he did at 8pm would bring in more cars to get a radio installed. He was working harder than he knew how to sustain, but had no plan or strategy to grow the business and maintain a level of growth that he was happy with. This is the problem with grinding and hustling. You are just grinding and hustling. I’m perfectly OK with spending a few weeks working extremely hard prior to launching a new product or opening a new store. But making that a way of life cannot, cannot, cannot be sustained and is not good for you. It wasn’t (and still isn’t) healthy for my dad.   
It took me a few businesses and many years to understand that I was copying patterns that I had learned from him in my own work habits. I used to think that my upper hand was that I was grinding harder than anyone. This logic works only up to the point when you meet other entrepreneurs who are grinding as hard as you are and are smarter, more experienced and have more funding. What then? What do you do when you can’t physically work yourself out of a problem? I’ll tell you what then; you’re fucked. Mentally, physically and in your business. 

My dad also had a gift that I noticed early on in my life. He could spot an opportunity before anyone else. I remember once driving with him down a road in Sandton many years ago. We stopped at an intersection and he looked to his right and said: ‘Wow, a Holiday Inn would do so well here.’ Lo and behold, five years later a Holiday Inn opened on that very spot. He had nothing to do with it and did not get rich from his ideas. This is a brutal lesson that I learned over and over and over from him throughout the years. He had vision, he had ideas and he was a great operator when he was in the business but he was extremely risk averse. We had a great life and my dad didn’t want to risk it all on opening a hotel\! That was insanity in his eyes. He needed to work hard to maintain our quality of life, not risk it all on some random idea that might not work.   
It’s amazing to look back and recognise my own fears mirrored in my memories of him. That’s all it was, fear. He was afraid of failing. He was afraid of starting again if the next idea didn’t work out. He was afraid of being judged by his family and friends. These are fears that we all share. I was lucky that I was able to watch them manifest, develop and engulf my dad from a distance and then realise when I was seeing them in myself. I was lucky because he showed me what it’s like when you don’t take the risks and rather choose the path most travelled. I owe my dad so much because he taught me to work harder than anyone else but to understand that smart work complements hard work. Hard work gets you only so far, though. You cannot work more than 24 hours in a day. That’s just math. If we’re realistic about it most people need to sleep occasionally so a 24-hour day is impossible. You can’t work hard forever. At some point smart work is going to free you from hard work. My dad taught me to be cautious but to pounce on an opportunity when it appeared and dive in head first, not tiptoe into the water. Without realising it, my dad taught me a lot about what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. Thanks, Dad.

## **16 AND STARTING SMALL**

Every person I have ever met has an idea for a business, an app, a product or something that they wanted to create. I have met a lot of people who don’t want to talk about their idea in case someone takes it from them and builds it first (or better). I have met a lot of people who are waiting for the perfect time or the perfect plan before they get started. I have also met a lot of people who want to build the biggest and best business right out of the gates.   
I have never built a business expecting that it was going to make me a billionaire. I build businesses because I want to do something interesting, unique and challenging or because I want to solve a problem that no one else has solved before. I like making money, having money and spending money, but over time I’ve learned that starting a business to give you financial freedom will almost always end in disappointment. The businesses that I have loved the most and the ones that I’ve put the most into have always been the ones that I believed were truly solving a problem, they were the businesses that pulled me in the most. Money was always a secondary goal.  
One of my favourite Paul Graham essays is titled ‘Do Things That Don’t Scale’. Here’s a short excerpt: 

*... Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure.*  
*That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb. Almost all startups are fragile initially. And that’s one of the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them. They unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones. They’re like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding ‘there’s no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything ...’*

What a great way to think of your first small business; it’s a little newborn baby that has to learn how to exist in the world. Your startup needs to figure out how to speak, hold its head up, crawl, walk, eat and eventually contribute in a meaningful way to society.   
At the time I was building it, I didn’t even realise that my first business was in fact my first business. It was just a school project that I had to complete. Looking back, I realised that it was the very first time in my life that I began to understand the concept of supply and demand and got a taste of selling a product to a target market. This business was tiny, made me no money but taught me a shitload without me even noticing.   
Not every business you start can be a billion dollar baby. It’s just not possible. So start small and do things that don’t scale.   
High school was the first time I really tasted the entrepreneurial life. As part of our Grade 10 curriculum, we were expected to start a small business. I mean, a really small business. The person who made the most profit at the end of the competition would be crowned the winner.   
At this point, the school isn’t really explaining what net profit vs gross profit is. They don’t really go into too much detail about how to account for your expenses and the main goal is to spark some interest in kids who might like the idea of buying low, selling high and making a profit. Simple and effective.  
I chose to play into my Greek heritage and sell worry beads. Worry beads are a little gadget that people play with to calm the mind. There are about 20 beads on a piece of string/rope/leather and you pass the beads one by one through your fingers until you’ve reached the end of the beads and then you flip them over and start again from the beginning. I had chosen the more modern version of this little toy that has two beads on either end of a piece of leather. The two beads, when played with in your hands, clang and clack together to make quite a noise. You can pass the leather part between different fingers and around your thumb to move the entire thing from one end of your hand to the other or just flip them around, clanging and clacking on one another for hours. Not ideal for a learning environment like a school. The competition began and as with anything at a school level, some people took it very seriously and some people did not. Some of the kids chose to mock the enthusiastic ones and some chose to be the enthusiastic ones. Isn’t it funny how school prepares you for life: the enthusiastic and engaged are often mocked when they should be applauded and pushed to engage further.  
I took out a loan from the bank (my dad) of R500. I found worry beads that cost R5 each and decided to triple the price to R15. I figured that if I came out with R1000 at the end of the competition I’d be in good shape. Sadly, I was mistaken. I hustled my face off selling worry beads to everyone and anyone that I could find. I sold them at Sunday lunches with family. I sold them at school sports games. I sold them at break time, class time, lunch time, after school time, dinner time and any damn time I could. Eventually I sold them all and was done. I had made my R1000 ‘profit’ and figured I was going to win the competition.  
In spite of selling every single item of my inventory and having the worry beads banned from school because of the clanging and clacking of the beads in class, I did not win the competition. There was a kid who had his parents come to school at break time every day with a carload of McDonald’s. That kid won. I believe I could have won that competition but I stopped selling. Never stop selling. I thought that I was beating out my competition when actually I should have been competing against myself and trying to make as much money as possible, but instead I was trying to beat other 16-year-olds and their parents. What frustrates me now looking back is that this experience did not push me to start my own business at 16\. I wish it had. I wish I had started my first real business immediately after this school experiment. This is a major lesson that I try to tell as many young people as I can: start right now. You are never too young or too old. 

Something much more important happened to me in high school. Something that I would only truly understand as a significant event many years later in life.  
I took computer science as an elective course until I matriculated. I did not excel in this class at all. In fact, I would go so far as to say I sucked at computer science because I didn’t really grasp the long-term value and therefore didn’t pay it much attention. But this class was definitive. It helped me keep my brain in the world of incoming tech. Everything was about to change and I was a tiny part of coding the change. Sort of.  
Computers were a fascination of mine from a fairly young age. I can’t understand it now, but my parents decided to buy our house an Internet enabled computer when I was just ten years old. My brother and I were meant to share it, but it quickly became my computer and was moved into my room. Let me put this into perspective for you because today it may seem slightly stupid to make a big deal about Internet in my room when we have Internet in our pockets. Back in 1996 less than 0.9 per cent of the world had Internet at all. I had a connection in my room. By the year 2000 less than 6 per cent of South Africans had access to Internet. I had already had Internet for four years. I was lucky and privileged.   
I have no idea why my parents let a ten-year-old boy have his own computer with an Internet connection but I can only assume it’s because they didn’t know what I could have been doing. With the computer now mine and the Internet connection firing up I was ready to rock and roll online. I had my first email address (nax@global.co.za because when you are 12 you use the nickname that your mom gave you as your email; naxs as in Nic Naxs). I was learning how to touch-type and I had access to the world and could have been doing anything.  
What I was actually doing was learning how to build websites, joining chatrooms in mIRC and finding my way through the world wide web using Alta Vista, Hotbot and Lycos (those are search engines, just in case you’re too young to have experienced these services before the Google). It was an amazing time online. People were slapping each other with virtual fish, everything was new and everyone was happy to be surfing the web, man. There were no trolls, or at least too few to find me.  
I started to learn HTML. I started to develop an online persona and figure out how to buy domain names, which back in 1996 wasn’t so easy. I figured out what Telnet was, I found like-minded people online who guided me through my HTML issues and shared in my frustration. As I hit my early teens I figured out that you could have ‘cybersex’ (talk a little dirty) and started trying to meet girls in chatrooms and connect with them online. I failed dismally.  
This period in my life was also the first (and last) experience that I had trying to break into someone else’s computer via the Internet. I found someone online who became a fast friend. We were both intrigued by the idea of ‘hacking’ and through the wonders of the web figured out how to unlock access to some random person’s pc. We did it with relative ease. Fortunately neither of us had bad intentions. We shat ourselves at the prospect of harming this person in any way or being caught and left almost as soon as we got in. Hacking career over.

Throughout my teenage years my parents always impressed upon me that it was important to receive an education. Neither of them had a formal degree and they both regretted it. They both wanted desperately to give me the life that they never had. These were their words repeated over and over and used to lay the Greek guilt on thick and fast at every opportunity. To be honest, I was never really sure what that meant. It always looked to me that they had great lives. We had enough. Enough money to buy food. Enough money to buy a house. Enough of just about anything we wanted. We were privileged. I lived a fortunate and privileged childhood and I am grateful for and aware of this every day. But that didn’t change my parents’ sentiment: a promising future can only be assured with a degree in the sciences. Who knows why the sciences were such a focus for them but this is what I was thrust into.  
My parents made me take science as one of my elective subjects. I hate the kind of science that they teach in school. I just could not understand the application of chemistry in my life. I was never going to be in a lab mixing together two Hs and an O to make H2O. Never. Gonna. Happen. Because I couldn’t understand the long-term application to my life, I flunked out of every science class I had. My parents even made me take extra science classes to try to help me with that ‘A’. I did not get an ‘A’ for science. I got a hard ‘E’ and barely received university exemption. Mathematics wasn’t any better for me. I struggled through higher grade math and managed to scrape a ‘B’ at the end of matric with the help of an extra math teacher who spoke to me exclusively in Greek. As if my life and math weren’t hard enough, I was forced to study it in Greek. It was literally all Greek to me.  
Nevertheless, I managed to make it through high school and flee to a small town far away from my family, friends and my past and any other resemblance of myself.  
I’ve done a lot of things in my life for no particular reason other than pure enjoyment and intrigue. Learning to play guitar was one such hobby and understanding computers, the power of the Internet and how to code was probably the most significant one in my teenage years. I didn’t know it at the time but the Internet would go on to define our entire world. The next time you dismiss a hobby or interest in your life because it has no clear and specific purpose I’d urge you to rethink and then double down. Embrace your hobbies because you genuinely never know when they are going to become relevant in the broader world or useful in your daily life outside of the hobby. Fuckit, even if that never happens you’ll have a new skill and do something that you love just because you love it. That’s a luxury we can and should all afford ourselves.

## **HOW FAR? THUS FAR**

Oftentimes there is a single factor that can make or break a business. One single thing that entrepreneurs can look back on and specifically know made their business a raging success or a calamitous failure. But this is not always the case. Sometimes it’s the sum of all the parts that make a business fantastic. It can also be the sum of all the parts that ensures that a business is destined to fail. One of my very first business experiences out of high school was massively fun but never profitable and doomed for failure because the sum of the parts did not make us better, but worse. This business was a band.  
My high school years were spent learning the rules and then understanding how to manipulate them to achieve my goals. My goals were pretty straightforward and socially acceptable. I attended an all-boys Catholic high school so those goals were easy:

* Become head prefect  
* Pass matric with university exemption  
* Play first team rugby

I was driven enough to achieve these three simple goals. I took them all very seriously because high school is serious business when you are 17\. To me, being head prefect was a real responsibility; I had people looking up to me who were young and impressionable. So I didn’t drink, smoke or do very much else that would have made my last year of high school fun.  
As a result, when I finally landed in Grahamstown at Rhodes University I was ready to explode. Within the first week at this revered academic institution I had gotten high, gotten leglessly drunk and gotten laid. It was a fantastic, life-altering week and, if I’m honest, I can’t actually remember it too well. It opened my eyes to the world outside of rules, parents and Catholic teachers.  
Arriving at university and being on my own for the first time in my life was incredible. I was never homesick, I never missed my high school friends, I didn’t miss my home, I was looking forward and loving it. But I had no new friends yet.  
Fortunately I had a hobby that helped me find like-minded people; I played the guitar. So I took out my guitar and started playing. Can you picture the scene: a young and bearded 18-year-old whipping out his guitar at university with his door wide open waiting for someone to stumble by and be his friend because they liked the guitar, or something. Lo and behold, it worked\!  
At many universities there is a system to help people make friends. In Orientation Week you are forced to do certain tasks that thrust you towards other people in the hope of bonding you to them forever. One of these traditions at Rhodes is called Serenades. It is what it sounds like. The male students from the same residence all band together and walk over to the female residence at 5am after a night of drinking, all of you in your pjs and you sing a song, have a cup of coffee and then go back to bed.  
If you’re paying attention, you’ll realise that I was flagged early on as an asset to the first-year men in my residence. My door wide open on that first day let everyone know that I could play the guitar when we went serenading. The pressure this put me under through O-Week was worth it because through this small chance of fate I met the men who would become partners in my very first and very real business.  
O-Week wrapped up and I started to find my feet and find my circle of friends. It just so happened that my circle of friends included a violinist, a guitar player, a singer and a drummer. By the second semester Courtenay, Bevan, Terrance, D and I had started a band. What this really meant was that we gathered together in one of our rooms and got high, jammed some of our favourite songs and talked shit for hours on end. Eventually Bevan and I started to write songs together, rehearse them and play them for the other guys.  
After a few more weeks we started discussing the idea of practising in a room together with all of our gear set up and really having fun with it. We chose some of the hits of the day, found the music, learned our parts, got into the room and ... sucked. Big time. We were terrible in the beginning. Our own songs were even worse. We had no idea how to rehearse them, how to structure them, how to fit together. We were stuffed in a tiny storeroom that our residence had agreed to let us use if we cleaned it out. We barely fit. I mean that literally. If we were all in the room with a drum kit, amps, guitars and then we closed the door I would be tapping Bevan on the shoulder with the neck of my guitar while he tried to sing. We thought we were the shit. We had it all, a university band, songs, a rehearsal space, a fucking violinist. We had a violinist in our band\! How were we not going to be famous and rich? We even had what we thought was a cool band name: Thus Far.  
Looking back now, I consider this band to be my first real business and my bandmates to be my first real business partners. I wish that I had realised it at the time because it would have helped us a lot if we thought of our group as more of a business than a stuff around hobby.  
Through the band I learned many lessons compounded into a very intense two-year period while I was studying.  
Working with gifted musicians taught me that I need to always practise my craft. If you think you’re good enough you probably aren’t. If you think you need more practice, then you should practise more. You can always, always learn more about your trade. As a band we definitely had more confidence than we had practice and this set us back time and time again but at no point did anyone in the band actually suggest and commit to practising more as we started to improve and pick up more gigs. We just didn’t practise more. We felt like playing a live gig was practice.   
I was a huge culprit. I would get on stage and realise that the people with me on the stage were much, much better musicians than I was. I distinctly remember standing on my side of the stage, turning to my left and thinking: ‘How the fuck did these guys let me up here with them?’ Did this make me practise more? Nope. Completely senseless but true. Unfortunately one of us needed more practice than the rest and it wasn’t me, but I’ll get to that shortly.   
We booked our first gigs at student events around campus. We played the battles of the bands and did not win any of them. We continued to practise a little and gig and write songs and generally have fun with it. Our gigs began to get slightly bigger. We started to take things more seriously and formulate real plans. The first real move I made to thrust us all into business mode was raising money to put an album together. I honestly can’t tell you what made her to do it, but one of my high school friend’s mom gave me R20 000 to record an album. I was visiting home in one of our holidays and had some of our songs with me on a CD. They were shitty recordings but good enough to spark her interest. She listened while we were drinking and talking and after I gave her a short pitch she offered me the money to record a proper album. My mind was blown. I had just raised my first round of capital.  
I thanked her, accepted the offer and called my bandmates to tell them that we needed to practise more\! Unfortunately, we did not.  
Throughout my time with Thus Far I experienced constant and crippling Impostor Phenomenon. I was playing music with three incredibly gifted musicians and I felt completely inadequate. I was in waaaay over my head. Strangely this still did not push me to practise more than we were already practising. It didn’t push me to go for guitar lessons or try to improve my playing at all. I couldn’t think myself out of this fear that I wasn’t good enough. Unlike Kirk Hammett who joined Metallica and insisted on continuing guitar lessons with Joe Satriani. Kirk joined one of the greatest rock bands in the world and decided that he was not good enough and needed guitar lessons. I was part of a university band in Grahamstown, South Africa and I believed that I wasn’t good enough to be where I was but didn’t need guitar lessons to improve.  
As we rehearsed more, grew our song repertoire and became more confident as a band as musicians we played more and more gigs around the Eastern Cape. We had a song on the radio and were playing once or twice a month together on stage and even earning some money for the events we played. We decided that if we were going to be taken seriously as a band we had to ‘tour’ Johannesburg, the big smoke, the place where musicians were making it. Being from Joburg meant that I had to do a fair amount of the planning. I booked three gigs and started to tell my friends and family. We all made plans to drive up to Joburg, stay for a week and play three venues. We arrived, got ourselves all psyched up, took a day to plan, fine tune and rehearse before our first gig.  
We rocked up to the venue to set up our gear at about 7pm. Nothing happens at any venue at 7pm so we weren’t surprised that it was empty. The sound engineer was there helping us with our setup but that was it in terms of support crew at this venue. One guy. We set up, we tuned, we sound checked and then we waited.  
And waited.  
And waited a little bit longer.  
Until 9pm swung round and literally not a single other person arrived at the venue.  
We had a tough decision to make that night: take everything down and leave or stay and play to an audience of one (the sound engineer).  
At 9:30pm we decided to get on that stage and rock out as hard as we could. We played our entire 45-minute set to one guy and he didn’t even look that interested. It was brutal. It was one of the most depressing things I can actually ever recall choosing to experience. But we played and made it out alive.  
Looking back on that gig now, I am not surprised that no one pitched up. We didn’t do any marketing. I assumed the venue would do that bit for us and I guess I thought that people would pitch up, discover us and then be our fans. That’s not how it works, folks. We didn’t have the stomach or the stamina for what it really takes to be a famous band. I now know that it takes hundreds and hundreds of gigs just like that one. I now know it takes many years of hard work building a fan base. I now know that it takes a shitload of marketing to drive feet into any venue for any band. I did not know those things back then.   
This was an important lesson for me in marketing. Having a good product (good music) is just what gets you into the game. Lots and lots of people make good or even great music. It’s not enough to just be good because at the top level you’re just like every other good musician out there. You have to be incredible and then you constantly have to tell people that you exist. Marketing becomes the main part of your job at a certain point in a band or a business. If you think you can just build it and people will come then you’re in for a surprise. Thus Far did not do a good job telling people we existed. If I’m honest, we also weren’t the best band out there either and that’s a detrimental combination for a new band.   
When we arrived at the next Johannesburg venue that we were booked to play, things looked much more positive. There was an actual stage, people already sitting at their tables ordering drinks and looking at the dinner menus. This was a big gig for us at a venue called The Blues Room in what used to be the Village Walk shopping centre. You enter through a single door hidden at the darkest, loneliest entrance of the mall and then walk down a staircase with posters signed by the artists who had played there before I was even born. You leave the staircase and enter a smoke-filled room with a stage to one side near the bar and tables throughout the rest of the place. The lighting is low and the buzz is real. We unpacked our stuff, set everything up, sound checked and then went straight to the bar to wait for the show to begin.   
Looking back, I cringe at the show we put on. We had a short set of about six songs that we had rehearsed but we were not crisp or professional on stage. Our lead singer hadn’t yet figured out how to talk to an audience and really engage them. We hadn’t figured out if we were a hard rock band with fast paced songs that got people off their chairs and bouncing or if we were a soft rock band that wanted people to sit and sip their wine while listening to us serenade them. I remember looking into the small collection of people and seeing my family members, friends and acquaintances and dying a little bit inside. We had put on a sub-par performance and I had hated it. We needed more practice.   
Out of the five band members, three were gifted, one was average and we discovered that one of us just wasn’t going to cut it.  
After recording our first album as a band we realised that we had a drummer problem. He was struggling to keep time when we played live and was a major stumbling block when we were recording. We were on a very tight budget and any extra takes cost us money in a studio. In hindsight, I was probably a worse musician than D but the guitar parts that I wrote for myself were manageable and my mistakes were very much less noticeable than if we had a drummer who was off time or whose rhythm and speed varied through each song.  
In a movie style secret meeting we gathered without D (we’ll call him D) and it was decided that we would need to fire him and replace him with someone else who could really take us to the next level, musically. You can tell that we’re taking this seriously now. Our gigs are getting bigger and bigger, we’re playing at festivals, we’re talking to record labels and considering doing this band thing after we all graduate. We needed a drummer who matched our ambition.  
Unfortunately, I was the only hard-ass in the band so it was left to me to have the talk with D. It was brutal. It was my first experience firing someone. In fact, it was my first real experience having this level of direct business conflict with a colleague. Not only was D our drummer but he was our friend, he was in res with us and we had bonded with him. But ambition outweighs loyalty when you are an arrogant 20-year-old. I did the deed and almost immediately regretted choosing band over friend. However, I was honest, straightforward, didn’t make anything up and didn’t pull any punches. D did not react well and rightfully so. He didn’t see it coming and I became the evil dick who kicked him out of the band.  
So we found ourselves a new drummer, Steve. He was incredible. In fact, he was way better than any of us expected or planned for. The thing is, he wasn’t too keen on actually taking the band forward into rock superstardom and we quickly realised that we were in trouble. Not only that but as the end of our time at Rhodes closed in on us, we all really began thinking about the band as a viable career path post University. The lead singer was really the most organised when it came to his future. He had a plan and, unbeknownst to us, Thus Far was not in it.  
Bevan had applied for and received an offer to work at Unilever. I remember the moment like it was yesterday. We were recording a few more songs in Durban and were at Courtenay’s house one night. We had a good day in the studio and were discussing the prospect of signing a touring contract to open for one of SA’s biggest bands when Bevan dropped the bomb: we should absolutely tour, but not with him. He had landed a job and would be choosing his career in marketing over his career as a singer. Smart man.  
That was the end of the band.

When I arrived in Grahamstown I built up the confidence to talk to random strangers about my passion for music and it ended up with us all starting a band, raising a tiny amount of capital from a friend’s mom and touring our music around the country. There is never a bad time to talk about what you are building and engage with other people about their passions and yours. If you open up about what you love to do in an honest way then you are likely to get back the same honesty and enthusiasm. You never can tell where your next opportunity, sponsor, investor, employee or partner might come from. This is difficult for a lot of people because they don’t like to always be selling or closing a deal, but for me it’s part of who I am. I am always going to tell you about what I do and ask you about your passions and past. I want to find out more about your abilities and intentions and see if there’s a way for us to work together to create something amazing. I’m always on. There is never a bad time to be selling yourself or your product. If you are serious about what you are doing then you should not be shy about it because you never know where it will take you. If you keep quiet and don’t engage I can almost guarantee you that nothing amazing will happen.

## **ACTIVATE**

Believe it or not, running a newspaper is actually a business. It’s as much about making money as it is about reporting, writing, photography and integrity. Journalists will tell you that isn’t true, but it is. When you are an aspiring writer all you want to do is write and you believe someone should pay you handsomely for that. When you get into your first year of studying journalism your lecturers have to go to great pains to explain that writing is a small part of a big machine that actually has to generate money to stay alive.  
The way that this happens at Rhodes is there is a student newspaper for the campus that is run exclusively by students, for students. It’s called *Activate*. It was founded in 1947 and back then was called *Rhodeo*. There’s a rich history of investigative and rebellious journalism there and it’s intoxicating when you first join up. Each year the first year newbies volunteer to write for the newspaper. Very quickly it becomes apparent that not everyone really wants to write. I was not one of these people. I was there to write. I was fulfilling a (short) lifelong dream. I signed up and committed to write for free for the next few years. I joined up with a few other first years and some of us managed to stick it out.  
I would walk around Grahamstown hunting for stories. Surprisingly, when you have a willing mind you can actually uncover some interesting things in unexpected places.  
There was a story about the extremist church called His People that would prey on innocent first-year students who felt vulnerable in Orientation Week and were drawn into the community of this extreme and cult-like religious sect. There were stories about rape (many more than there ever should have been). These were the most difficult stories to cover because often the alleged victim and perpetrator were in your class or residence and you had to try to interrogate them about this horrific thing. There was a story about a young street kid who I met after shouting at him for leaning on my car. I befriended him and started to write up a longform lifestyle piece on his family. His father was an alcoholic, his mother had died and he and his siblings would hunt around Grahamstown each day for odd jobs, beg for money and try to hustle food to survive. They could not afford to pay the R200 a term to attend school.   
As I came to show more and more interest in the newspaper the senior staff noticed that I was an easy target to take on their roles when they graduated. So after my first year of writing for the news section I was elected to become the news editor. This year of my life taught me how to rally. University is all about extremes: Stay out late and get as drunk as you can and then wake up early to go to lectures. Stay up late writing a 15-page essay due the next day but instead go out and get drunk and then have to do it while still intoxicated. Sometimes you do both, sometimes you do neither. Work hard, play harder and hope you pass. But adding News Editor to my work load in second year really pushed me to the brink of sanity. In hindsight, good preparation for starting a business.  
Every week I would gather my writers, discuss topics and then try to engage them to write the stories and deliver them to me within the week and on deadline. This never went to plan, obviously. This meant that we were going to print with sub-standard work that was not particularly engaging or interesting. This also meant that our readership was on a consistent decline and the knock-on effect of this was less and less advertising in the pages. There’s a really simple model when it comes to magazines and newspapers: full page adverts keep publications afloat. Without proper monetisation of the pages there are no pages.  
Something that I’ve learned over time and didn’t realise when I was the Deputy Editor of the newspaper in my third year is that it’s extremely hard to build and scale something in a small place with a tiny audience. I mean small in the literal sense of the word. Grahamstown is a small town. I worked for the paper for three years and by the end of it could tell you every police officer’s name and who to call if a student had been arrested to get the inside scoop (yes, lots of students were arrested). The tough part is that there may always be a story but the audience doesn’t really grow. Your readership is relatively stagnant and churns every year; new people arrive and old people move on into the world. This means that advertising is extremely tough to come by. There is only a single Spar and Pick n Pay in the entire town. There is a single Italian restaurant, a single cinema with three movie screens. The potential advertising pool is tiny. The revenue model didn’t and doesn’t scale.  
Scale matters when you are trying to grow a media company. You cannot scale a media business without a revenue model. BuzzFeed does stupid link bait articles about the top ten pink fluffy slippers you have to see a monkey wear so that they can get in the big ad money for the views and then use that money to do proper investigative journalism. The *Washington Post* has Jeff Bezos and his billions. *Activate* has none of this and struggles immensely to keep writers motivated without pay and printers happy without money.  
The newspaper back then was printed by the same company that produced and printed *Grocott’s* *Mail*, the local Grahamstown newspaper. This would be the first time that I had to enter into a formal negotiation about pricing. *Grocott’s* was charging us too much for the printing of *Activate* and we just couldn’t afford the costs. I went in to meet with Louise, the incredibly experienced woman who ran the business. She had a reputation as a bulldog who would chew up, spit out and stand on students year after year when they asked for a reduction in costs. I vividly remember walking through the printing press and seeing newspapers flying through rollers and up and around the warehouse. It’s a magical thing, seeing a newspaper being formed. There’s something deeply moving and spiritual for a writer to see his words emerge on a page and form into a thing that other humans will consume. The magical setting did not assist me in my negotiations with Louise in the slightest. She chewed me up and spat me out. She treated me like the inexperienced student that I was and I came away with a negligible discount that was more a slap in the face than a negotiated outcome to keep the newspaper alive. There was very little that I could do because I had no real choice in the matter. They were the only printers in Grahamstown and going to the bigger city of Port Elizabeth meant transport costs made that option impossible.  
That day I learned that you are what you let people think you are. Louise knew that I was coming to her as a student in a student newspaper with no budget and no options. She had all the leverage and I had none. What I needed was to approach Louise as an adult and an editor, not a student without leverage. Unfortunately, I was in the worse position and had no BATNA. It’s worth taking a few minutes to discuss the concept of BATNA. BATNA stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiation Agreement. In short, BATNA is a negotiation theory that explains the best outcome for each party if the negotiations fail. If I walked away from the negotiations and Louise decided not to print our newspaper then I had nothing, no newspaper, no alternative, nothing. If she lost the negotiations then we would end up paying her slightly less but she still had us as a customer and wasn’t very much worse off. I clearly had the worst outcome. She had all the BATNA and I was again in a position where I had very little leverage.

## **GET UP AND LIVE**

Sometime during my third year at Rhodes I was watching CNN like a good journalism student should and on came Bob Geldof. He was live on air and talking about the upcoming G8 summit. He looked right into the camera and started swearing in anger and frustration that nothing was being done to make the world a better place. He literally said ‘Fuck’ on live TV. On CNN. The man was immediately my hero. It felt like he was staring at me and urging me to get off my ass and do something. So I did.  
I had just turned 21 and decided that instead of having a massive party like my brother did, I was going to take the money. I negotiated the terms of my payout from my parents and the cash was sitting in my account when Sir Bob reached through the TV screen and spoke to me through various ‘fucks’ and ‘shits’ on CNN. This man was serious and I was a journalism and politics student so I was serious too, obviously. If I didn’t stand up get involved then who would?\! WHO, I ASK YOU?\!  
The very next day I booked my flights to Scotland so that I could be close to the events of the 31st G8 summit. I had my camera with me and contacted a few news organisations in South Africa to see if they were in the market for some frontline photographs of the G8 and the mess that was going to unfold. Not a single one of the newspapers I reached out to accepted my kind offer to take photographs for them. In fact, not a single one of the editors I contacted even responded. ‘Fuckit,’ I thought channelling my inner Geldof, I’m going to go anyways. I’m going to take the best photos I can take and then everyone will buy them from me when I return.  
I can confirm that this is not how photojournalism worked back when cameras were not digital. I had no way of getting my photos back to the local editors even if they did want to buy them from me. In fact, I had no way of developing the film once the photos had been taken. In short, I was severely underprepared and didn’t even know it. All I knew is that I had to place myself at the centre of the world when it was blowing up. This was my dream, this is what I had studied for and this is what I was going to do.  
I landed in Edinburgh without a plan. I didn’t know where I was going to stay, I didn’t know where the actual G8 summit was and I didn’t know how I was going to get there. This is the first time that I have been in another country on my own, spending ‘my own’ money and I was fucking hopeless. I don’t remember ever feeling that confused or alone. It was liberating.  
After stumbling around from bar to bar buying the cheapest drinks I could find it eventually became too late for me to do anything other than find the nearest hotel and book a room for the night so that I could start all over again the next day. Unfortunately for me, the nearest hotel was not the cheapest hotel for a student’s budget. I walked into the reception and deep down immediately knew that I was in over my head. I approached the reception and asked them for a room. They offered me a room that cost £100. I quietly said yes and handed over my card to pay.  
When I finally made it up to the room and had a moment to sit down and work out how much money I had just spent on my hotel room it was too late to change my mind. I had just spent almost five nights worth of accommodation money on one room. I was in shit now.  
It’s in the moments that you are most vulnerable that I believe you learn what you are made of. I was not made of money, I can tell you that much. I woke up the next morning, went down for breakfast and did what my great-grandmother had done at every buffet she had ever been to. I loaded up my plate with food that ‘travels well’, went back to my table, unfolded the serviette and filled it with the food on the plate. I then ate my fill and put the serviette food into my bag and left. That food kept me going for two days. The next move was to find out how the hell I get to the G8 Summit. I really did not think this trip through at all.  
I had a theory at this point: Protesters band together and they are more than likely cheap, like me. So I went to the hostel closest to the bus and train station and booked myself into a communal room with bunk beds. A significant saving of the money that I was quickly running out of. My hunch worked and there I met up with a dreadlocked protester who showed me around the city. Edinburgh is amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed walking the streets till late into the night. The next day this guy helped me onto his protest bus. The protesters were literally being bussed into the farmlands that surrounded the Summit. We were never, ever going to get even remotely close to the leaders of the free world. I had rolls and rolls of film, my backpack stuffed with food and water and I was ready for whatever was coming my way.  
I don’t want to sound too dramatic about this, because in truth it was not the most violent protest that I’ve either been in or witnessed, but arriving on the scene was quite an interesting experience. There were riot police on horseback, there were army helicopters diving towards and encircling the crowd with gunmen ready and waiting to fix any issue that may have arisen. When the protesters (and photographers) got too close, the riot horseback police would stroll up in unison and push us back. If that didn’t work the protesters were forcibly removed, arrested, trotted over or simply picked up and pushed along. As far as protests go, tame.  
I managed to take some incredible photographs that I still keep with me, but that’s it. I keep them with me. I did not sell them. I did not win any prizes and in fact I’d go so far as to say that not a single soul knew or cared that I was ever at the G8 summit that year.

The trip back to South Africa was uneventful and as a business venture it was a complete and utter failure. I had no plan, I had no buyers for what I was selling, I had no source of income and all the money that I spent was gone. But, man alive, I’d do it all again to experience the rush and thrill of being a photographer at the G8 summit taking photos of riot police smashing protesters over the head with a baton.  
That experience, as much as it was thrilling, helped me realise that my plans to become a war correspondent were not well thought out and more than likely over.  
It was also this experience that pushed me to finish my four-year journalism degree one year early and only receive my BA. I needed to get into the real world and practise the theory I had spent three years learning.

## **STUDENTWIRE**

While studying a degree in journalism, politics and philosophy at Rhodes was good and all that, I am no academic. I like learning the theory so I can apply it in practice. There is very little practice to be had in Grahamstown, let me tell you. The newspapers are tiny, the news is slow and the population is small.  
Back in 2003 a guy called Matt Mullenweg built a website platform called WordPress. Today WordPress claims to power more than 25 per cent of the Internet. This was not the case back in 2003 when I first started blogging.  
My first blog was a simple repository for the photographs I was taking on my photojournalism course. This was actually a ton of work back in 2003\. I was taking photos on a film SLR camera, going into a dark room and then developing the photos myself. Today, using a dark room is mostly reserved for fine artists and purists. I was doing it every day as part of my day. Take a photo, use up the entire 36 shot film, replace, repeat and complete your day. Head into the dark room, develop the photos, leave them overnight to dry off and finish the process. Then come back the next day to take the film and place it into a scanner so that I could scan in the photos to start trying to use this new digital editing thing called Photoshop. I would also take the dark room photos and scan them and then upload those to my blog.  
It was a ridiculous amount of work but this first blog was a revelation to me. Studying media while experiencing the shifting landscape of the very topic of my exams was an interesting ride. While my lecturers were talking to us about magazines and newspapers and I was spending hours in a darkroom developing film, I was building a blog and self-publishing for free.  
This sparked a business idea for me and two of my friends and fellow journalism students, Carly and Gregor. We had all joined the local student newspaper *Activate*.  
Carly, Gregor and I decided that students would want news if they had access to it in digital form. The Internet, man\! It’s going to change everything\! At least that’s what we thought. Our idea was simple in theory; Gather news from universities around the country and create South Africa’s first online student news portal. We called it Studentwire.net.  
The idea was solid and we thought we had the chops to execute it once the website was built. Unfortunately, we weren’t technically advanced enough at this point to build a content management system that would carry such ambitions. In fact, back in 2004 the concept of a content management system wasn’t in the mainstream. You couldn’t just download a scalable platform, load it up onto a virtual server, buy a domain and crack on. Someone had to build the CMS for you, design the website, code it and then build it.  
We had just the person.  
This was the first time that I would meet a man who would help me define the next ten years of my life for the better and the worse. Vincent (let’s call him ‘V’ for the purposes of this book) was the New Media lecturer in the journalism department and Gregor and Carly believed that he would be interested in helping us build StudentWire.  
We set up a meeting with Vincent at the local pub, the Rat and Parrot, and offered him beer and food to listen to our idea. He agreed and we all sat down around a sticky bar table to discuss the future of media and our business idea.  
My first impression of Vincent was that he was a socially awkward and intelligent guy who knew a helluva lot about digital, media and technology and was going to be difficult to get close to. I also got the feeling that I should do what I could to get close to him because he knew things that I needed to learn. He knew things that other people didn’t even think to learn about. He had thick glasses through which he would squint disapprovingly at his students. He wore mostly black, mostly T-shirts and mostly didn’t seem to care about how he looked in public. To be fair, we were in Grahamstown so no one really seemed to care how they looked in public. From the outset Vincent was intimidating. I would later learn that he was intimidating by design. As his students you were forced to strive for his level of excellence which was high and his level of understanding which was deep. You were not able to coast along and simply pass. This is how it was to be with StudentWire too. There was no middle ground. When Vincent spoke it was often in fits and starts and then flowing and eloquent sentences referring to research that no one had read and philosophers who no one had heard of.  
We pitched the concept and V, surprisingly, agreed to help us build the platform and launch it. This was a big deal for three students to have a lecturer endorse your idea and actually offer to help you build it. We were off\!  
It took a few months to actually get the site built. It also took a lot of nagging from me to get Vincent to focus on our little project. I distinctly remember this being the first time in my life that I experienced a feeling of not understanding my value in a relationship. This feeling would go on to haunt me into my thirties. In this relationship Vincent was the developer and designer, he was the lecturer and the expert. We were just the kids with the idea and we had to tread carefully to find a balance between being demanding and actually completing the project. It was exciting, nerve-racking and also a little intimidating to be on the brink of doing something that could change the student media landscape forever.  
This is so typical of how students think. When you are at university you have the luxury to believe that the world you live in is the most important world there is. I was a journalism student experiencing the Internet revolution in real time and I was certain that everyone else understood the importance and that our idea was going to make us rich and famous.  
There was one major stumbling block that we did not factor into the equation: students don’t give a toss about news. Sure, some of them do but most students want to study, drink, party, have sex, experiment with drugs and repeat. They do not want to pay for news or spend their time reading about other university campuses and their latest drama. At least, this was the case over a decade ago. There was no Facebook. There was no BuzzFeed. Most newspapers were still offline and had no intention of moving into digital because the phrase ‘moving into digital’ had never really been discussed. Now, I like to believe that students are more engaged with the world around them and the things that might affect their lives. In Grahamstown in 2005 the things that affected me included the price of a beer, the location of my smokes and the party I was going to that night \[notice how my lectures, classes and essays do not enter my realm of concern\].  
It didn’t bother us that traffic was slow and news was hard to come by. Carly, Gregor and I were up and running. However, early on in the partnership we realised we had a very fundamental problem. I wanted to make money and they did not. They had envisioned StudentWire as a not for profit business and I am a capitalist at heart. I wanted to build our audience and sell ads on the site to make money and scale the business. It’s incredible to me that between the three of us we didn’t discuss this before we dived into the business but we were so excited about the act of bringing student news together on one platform that we couldn’t help ourselves.   
We just started, built and got going. We didn’t think about money; we wanted to change the world. Carly and Gregor didn’t really consider how the business would sustain itself and I didn’t consider that there might be a way to run a business without making money. I imagine they were thinking that we could find funding somewhere or have ads but never take money out other than our salaries. This was properly crazy to me. I just could not understand why you couldn’t both change the world and make a sizeable profit. The two are not mutually exclusive. This obviously caused a major split between us and ultimately I took StudentWire on as my own.  
Now the business was all mine and I was free to build it as I saw fit. We parted ways on relatively good terms and I hadn’t damaged the friendships too badly. I got down to business and began recruiting journalism students from all the campuses I could think of. I ended up with commitment from 12 universities that they would contribute news to our platform on a weekly basis. This was the next major hurdle in my race to fame and fortune. Trusting students without paying them or contracting them in any official way is not a smart idea. Trust does not pay the bills, trust does not ensure commitment. Trust is bullshit. Students want to drink beer and enjoy their time at university. It’s hard work submitting five written articles and a few photographs every week on a Friday when everyone around you is gearing up for a party weekend.  
Slowly but surely the students who showed commitment started to drop off. I replaced them and then those students dropped off and so the cycle of recruitment went. I managed to keep this venture going for two years, even after I had graduated with my bachelor’s degree in journalism but it became more and more difficult to justify working on a dying business.  
A significant part of the StudentWire technology that I didn’t even know we were missing was an advertising platform. I took for granted that I had to manually manage the adverts. There was no cost per click model in 2005; if there was, I didn’t know about it or how to use it and there sure as shit was no audience in South Africa to target. In fact, Google AdWords only launched in 2000 so five years into its existence and StudentWire was still uploading banner ads manually as pieces of content to the website and setting calendar reminders to take them down after a certain period of time. Not a scalable model.  
Fortunately there was no need to worry about scale because StudentWire was dying as quickly as my degree was coming to an end.  
Once you leave your university and enter the world you learn that the world really doesn’t care about the latest student scandal.  
Keeping StudentWire alive was impossible once I left Grahamstown and the project would die with a whimper and not a bang.

## **DIGSPOT**

When things get tough in business it’s easy to think that you can build your way out of the problems. Build bigger offices and hire more people if there’s too much work. Build a better website if the traffic isn’t converting. Build more features if the silly users aren’t interested in the features you have. But sometimes building more things is part of the problem. Sometimes it’s better to walk away than to start again or keep building.   
It’s easy to get caught up in a trend of the time and think that you can get in front of it. The chances are, if you are building for a trend once it’s already gaining ground, you’re too late. No amount of new features will help you fix your problem of timing and traction. This is a lesson that would follow me from my next business, Digspot, through to other businesses I would go on to found like Motribe. With Digspot we were starting waaaay behind just about anyone building a social network anywhere in the world who was taking this trend seriously. We had much less funding, worse technology, terrible design and a slew of other issues that were insurmountable.   
Money does not solve systemic problems in a business. Money probably enhances those problems. Sometimes you cannot throw money at a problem and make it go away. Sometimes raising funding only serves to highlight the problems that you just can’t fix. I was soon to find out that deeply embedded technological problems don’t get magically resolved when you raise funding. Sometimes the partners you have just aren’t the right people to fix the problems in your business. What follows is a story about bad timing, bad execution and bad fund-raising. 

My parents had committed to a four-year degree in journalism. This degree is called a BJourn (Bachelor in Journalism). This is not the degree that I left university with. I graduated with a BA in Journalism, which is a three-year undergrad and not a four-year post-grad degree. It’s just a degree like any other with Journalism as the focus. I did not give a shit about the degree and in fact to this very day I have never taken the piece of paper that my degree is printed on out of the little canister that it came in. Not a single job I’ve ever had has requested my degree. The most that I’ve been asked is: ‘Did you complete your degree?’ I answer a firm ‘Yes’ and then we moved on to the interview questions.  
I bolted out of Grahamstown as soon as I could because I was bored and tired of the same people doing the same things and talking about the same shit. I have selective and undiagnosed attention deficit disorder. I’m ADD by choice. When I feel the itch, I walk (or run) away and do something new. So I ran away from Grahamstown taking StudentWire with me, moved on from Thus Far and started the real world hustle.  
Courtenay (remember the violinist from the band?) and I decided to take on StudentWire in Johannesburg and make a go of it. While we developed the platform and engaged with the student journalists from universities around the country we were trying to create a community and engage them with technology. Technology does not bind people together. As I learned with Thus Far, if you build it, they don’t just come. Technology can be used to enhance relationships and experiences that might already exist or might only exist if the technology is there. But just because you have built something does not mean people will flock to it. Building some random website is not the same as building Facebook. This, again, was StudentWire. We had news, we had a website, we had some sort of design, user profiles and all sorts of things that just didn’t attract eyeballs. Eyeballs are what advertisers pay for and we had none. No eyeballs, no advertisers, no money.  
We then did what any reasonable person would have done in this situation; we built more features, new products and tried to raise funding for this Frankenstein Startup.  
As part of the StudentWire cluster, Courtenay and I launched Digspot.co.za. This was the next venture in my student-centric batch of businesses. Digspot is also the first venture that I raised serious investment to build.  
As Facebook was growing there were a host of entrepreneurs from around the world who wanted to latch on to this social networking fad and make it their own. Having just left university, I believed that there was value in starting a social network for students living off campus or looking to move off campus. There was a clear value proposition and market: appeal to students and get them connected to other students who were about to move into their own apartments, houses or living arrangements. They could share knowledge and information about their landlords, the going rate for rental, recipes to cook on the cheap for a house of two, three, four or more people and other very niche student-related problems. At this point Facebook wasn’t catering for South African students in any specific way and there seemed to be a gap in the market. So we started building.  
Courtenay and I situated ourselves at my mother’s dining room table for days on end. We forgot to shower and she let us know. We forgot to eat and she would feed us. We forgot about our partners and my mom would remind us to call them. At this point in time my life partner Jen had just moved to London and we were struggling through a long-distance relationship. It was not easy trying to build a startup and maintain a new relationship over a long distance. Stupidly, this was not the last time that Jen and I would attempt long distance while I was trying to build a business.  
And so Courtenay and I designed and we developed and we discussed and we debated – logo colours, navigation layout options, server issues and all of the minute details that actually weren’t really concerns for us at that exact time.  
We had no users.  
We had no funding.  
We had no revenue model.  
We had no traction of any kind.  
With nothing really to show for our work we were debating the position of the login box on the account page when we should really have been getting users into the system and testing everything out. ‘Done is better than perfect.’ This is a quote that is extremely popular today and originates from Facebook. I think. Either The Zuck said it himself or the Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said it. The Google search isn’t too sure. Regardless, it’s a great quote for startups the world over.  
Get it done. Then get it live. Then try to get it perfect sometime in the future maybe, if you have some time. Do then fail then learn then repeat. Any part in isolation won’t work out.   
The two of us did none of the above. It wasn’t done, it wasn’t live and it wasn’t even remotely close to workable, let alone perfect.  
We decided that we needed a partner and we found it in a guy called Christof. I met Christof at a geek event called the 27 Dinner (because it happened on the 27th day of every month). Christof was making a name for himself in traditional media and on the speaking circuit. He had started blogging and I also blogged. A mutual friend of ours ran the 27 Dinner events so Christof and I both think that Mike introduced us at one of these dinners. We hit it off immediately and I knew that he and I could work together and be an effective team.  
Something that I consider one of my greatest assets but also one of my most frustrating traits is that I am always looking for an angle. I’m always on. For me there is no balance between ‘life’ and ‘work’. For me work is life and vice versa. There’s that old saying that some people live to eat and some people eat to live (I live to eat – man, I love food) but for me the saying should be that some people work to live and others live to work. I live to work. So when I’m at an event and I meet someone I am not idly engaging with them, I’m trying to figure out their potential role in my life and mine in theirs. I’m trying to figure out if I can help them with something and, if the time comes, are they able to help me with something?  
 Fortunately for me, Christof was much the same at the time. When we met we both immediately tried to figure out the angle, the link, the connection and if we were suited to travel down the road together. Christof is a media genius and a storyteller second to none. He was the guy that we needed and I snapped him up to help us build, grow and finance the development and expansion of Digspot.    
Down the road, he would be the person who secured my job at the *Financial Mail* but in the short term he joined Courtenay and me in our vision to build the go-to student social network for South Africa. We pitched Christof the idea and within a matter of weeks he and I were meeting with potential investors to raise money for the business.  
At this point, StudentWire is still intimately intertwined into the core of Digspot. We’re trying to weave the two into a single platform where students can read the news and then engage in their community. Here is a very obvious example of misunderstanding your target audience. We genuinely, legitimately, believed that students wanted to join a social network that focused on news and related items and talk about that stuff with their friends. We misunderstood the core need of our target audience. That single mistake was going to break us into pieces as we continued to grow the platform and expand our ambitions.  
At this point it was impossible to miss the hype of technology startups hitting the news, Facebook gaining ground globally, entrepreneurs raising stupid amounts of capital for dumb ideas. I decided that our issue was that we did not have enough funding. The logic went as follows in my 21-year-old brain:

We don’t have any users.  
We need users.  
To get users we need to tell people that we exist.  
To do that we need to advertise.  
To advertise we need money.  
Ergo, lack of funding is holding us back.

Although not completely incorrect, this thinking is flawed because we had absolutely no traction and a subpar product. I’m not a designer but I know enough design to get a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) out. That’s what we had, a minimum viable product that was barely viable. Yet we were living the dream. I was deep in the startup experience of sitting in my mom’s house with a buddy and building something that we believed could really make a difference in the world. It was liberating and exciting and frustrating all at the same time. Courtenay and I were both working day jobs and Christof was running a consulting firm, so Digspot was a business that we were trying to build after hours on a dining room table with no money.  
Then Christof tapped into his network at FNB and they agreed to invest in our business – R100 000 (±$9000)\! This is a large amount of money for a young startup with no budget trying to make their side hustle a full-time gig. This was incredible news, but we all received the news differently. Courtenay is relatively risk averse so he was unable (unwilling) to leave his job without more traction, more funding and a better plan. None of those things are unreasonable but are equally impossible in the early phases of a startup about to raise an angel round of funding. So he was stuck. I was willing to commit but needed confirmation on the R100k before I pulled the trigger to leave my job. This all rested on Christof.  
And then silence. Days and then weeks went by without us hearing from Christof about the money we needed to kick-start our success. I emailed and heard nothing, called and got no response. Until we finally heard from Christof. He had been in hospital after an almost deadly spider bite. When he was released from hospital he was immediately hit with the news that two of his friends had been in a car crash and one had died.  
Things were messy, to say the least. Courtenay was hesitant, I continued to be as committed as possible and Christof was back to being fully engaged (once he made it out of his near-death experience). With frustration mounting and the funding finally coming into our account we became slightly serious and began to see some traction. Christof would head to a university for a media event or work-related visit and punt Digspot to anyone who would listen. He hustled a few hundred users at Wits and then another campus and then another. We were heading towards a real platform with real users. It was finally happening.  
The excitement was short-lived.   
I don’t really remember the specific event that triggered the end of Digspot but I do know that shortly after receiving the R100 000 in funding we all decided that the responsible thing to do would be to give the money back.   
We did what we thought was right and we gave the funding back.  
Why would three young and ambitious entrepreneurs give back angel funding? Because we had absolutely no clue what we were doing. In fact, that’s probably not even a good reason to not spend funding. We didn’t even know what field we were on, never mind what game we were playing or what the rules of the game were. Facebook was growing at an exponential pace, we were not as committed as we should have been and were lost for a strategy to pull everything together. We were in over our heads and Christof and I decided that instead of burning through the cash and destroying his relationships we would earn more respect by returning the money and walking away with the lesson learned. So that’s what we did.  
Very shortly after that Courtenay moved to Australia and I would take a job at *Financial Mail*. Christof continued to do incredible things in media all over the world. He and I still engage frequently about media and business and life, but Digspot died a quick death and along with it went StudentWire and my faith in any student-related business.

## **SOUTH AFRICA ROCKS**

I’m a passionate person. It’s in my blood. Greeks speak with their hands and a raised voice is not a shout, it’s just a passionate plea. That’s how I live and that’s probably how I’ll kick the bucket one day; in a fit of passion. For a long time my passion was heavily focused on South Africa. I believed strongly that SA was a phenomenal place to be (I still believe this but it’s become more complicated) and an incredible place to build a life and a business. In my early twenties I was so passionate about South Africa that I started a blog called SA Rocks. The goal was to post an article every day about something positive to do with the country. The blog grew into a website that existed for six years. The articles ranged from detailed political commentary on current affairs through to a guy who helped people at the scene of a car accident.  
The premise was simple in my mind: Everyone believes and promotes the negative things in the world so I wanted to publish the opposing views of positivity. I found good news all over the place. People contributed stories, photos and snippets of things they had seen or experienced. I also experienced daily death threats from right wing racist bastards who believed that being positive was tantamount to raping their mothers (that’s a reference from an actual death threat I received) and they would find me and give me something to complain about. People are crazy. Racists are batshit bonkers and South Africa has some of the most bonkers racists in the world. Fuck racists.  
This little site that I was slowly and organically growing started to gain traction. People started to take note of what I was trying to accomplish and I started to gain some media coverage around the country. I was featured in magazines and interviewed on the radio and every time that happened the website would grow. It was an interesting hype cycle of pain and joy. The bigger it grew, the more stories of happiness and good news I received. The more of these stories I published, the darker and more frequent the death threats became. There are many reasons to hate me, but I don’t believe that promoting positive stories about South Africa is one of them.  
I began to evolve the narrative of SA Rocks and lean heavily into the wave of positivity that people were looking for to hold on to as things became more unstable and confusing. Violence was on the up, crime was increasing and the political state was becoming more and more of a concern for people with any kind of insight into governance. Crime had become such a massive issue that in 2008 I involved SA Rocks and myself in a march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to submit an official document to the President to acknowledge and take under review. The march was spearheaded by Desmond Dube, the famed South African actor and singer.  
Embarrassingly, this march was touted by the media as a ‘Million Man March’ which it most certainly was not. You don’t get a million South Africans to do anything unless it involves a sports ball of some kind and a cup that we might win. Sad but true. Many South Africans are armchair activists and this march proved it. A few thousand people pitched up but I milked it for all it was worth. There were actors, musicians, radio personalities, families, cops and politicians (robbers) in the streets but I made damn sure that I was in front of the cameras and talking to the media.  
If you believe in your project the way that I believed in SA Rocks then there’s no embarrassment in promoting it. SA Rocks was one of the first businesses of mine that gained real traction in the media. What I was doing was topical and people wanted to talk to the idiot who felt that SA had a future that wasn’t bleak. I didn’t hold back and learned that the old sales adage Always Be Closing (ABC) is applicable in many scenarios. I was always telling people about SA Rocks. I was always talking about positivity and quickly became ‘The guy who promotes South Africa’. Brand South Africa even invited me to join foreign bloggers and media on a nationwide tour of amazing South African marvels. We all visited the deepest mine in the world, we flew in a helicopter to an offshore diamond mine, we stayed in incredible hotels, we toured Cape Town in a helicopter, we saw the local wind farms and did many more amazing things. Sure, I wasn’t earning a shitload of money from the site but I was gaining a reputation and experiencing things I would never have seen otherwise.   
As I continued to promote SA Rocks at every opportunity I became quite brazen on live TV and radio interviews. I realised that there is very little that anyone can do to stop you from promoting yourself on air when the interview is live. So whenever someone asked me something about SA Rocks, I’d repeat their question but start with: ‘At SaRocks.co.za we believe ...’, ‘Well, Mr Interviewer, at www.sarocks.co.za we like to ...’ Always, always be closing. Always be promoting. I became shameless in talking about my business and brand in a way that was actionable to the listener. Later in life I read The Everything Store book about how Jeff Bezos built Amazon.com and he deployed this little trick incredibly well. Amazon has dropped the ‘.com’ part but in the first years they were branded, spoken about, listed and discussed as Amazon.com. That was the actual business name. Genius. 	  
There was something that I did with SA Rocks that really helped us jump into the ranks of the top blogs in South Africa at the time. It was a really simple gimmick but it worked like nothing else that I did with this particular business. I created a digital badge for SA Rocks that other websites and blogs could put on their site and link back to mine. It was a badge that showed that these websites and people believed that SA did indeed Rock.  
That single move created masses of backlinks to www.sarocks.co.za that pushed us further and further up Google’s pagerank algorithm. The more websites that linked to us, the stronger our search presence became. The stronger the search presence became, the more traffic the site received and round and round it went. By 2008 the site had close to 50 000 unique visits per month which for a blog in South Africa back then really wasn’t bad going.  
The badges, the PR, the hype cycle and the consistency of posting an article every day for over five years began to pay off. Through the years after leaving university I had stayed in contact with V, the lecturer who had helped me to build StudentWire, and he and I had developed a mentor/mentee type of friendship. We’d shoot the shit often on Google mail chat (there was no WhatsApp or FB messenger back then) as we were both building our personal blogs and I had had some success with SA Rocks. Vincent struck up a relationship with Virgin Money and they were looking to get into the blog space and sponsor content that worked with their brand.  
We managed to come out with a deal that worked perfectly for me. Virgin Money wanted to place banners on the site exclusively and they would pay me for that. That was it. No conversion optimisation, no tracking, no click throughs, nothing like that. They wanted to be associated with a brand that fit their own and SA Rocks was one of those brands.  
They paid me R4 000 (±$350) a month for almost two years. That’s what success looked like at the time for a blogger in South Africa. In fact, there’s not really much difference between being a blogger a decade ago and being a blogger now. There isn’t that much money to be made. Writing is tough business.  
I kept SA Rocks rocking for as long as I felt I could. Eventually I decided to stop posting on the site and let it slowly fade away. There are many organisations, Facebook groups, news sites and people who have picked up the mantle of positivity in South Africa. I didn’t feel that my voice and the work at SA Rocks was making a dent. My goal of promoting South Africa and fighting the tide of negativity really wasn’t being achieved with a blog that reached a few thousand people. Sure, I could argue that every person I reached made a difference, but that wasn’t what I was trying to achieve. I was not succeeding.   
Sometimes it’s OK to let things go. If they aren’t achieving the goals you set out then you can either double down and do more or you can admit that you’ve done all you can do, learn and move on to try something else. I chose the latter. I decided to spend my time on other projects. I stopped blogging on the platform after six years and SA Rocks died and went to the big webserver in the sky to rest. I loved that site but I am glad that I closed it down when I did.

## **GET A JOB**

It may seem slightly strange to talk about getting a job in a book about building businesses, but working in big corporates taught me a lot of lessons which helped me to build better businesses. In short: I learned why I don’t want to be in corporates and have a boss in the traditional way and that pushed me deeper into the world of entrepreneurship.  
Each job taught me something different. Each job taught me about myself as well as the people I worked with. Each job provided me with insight into a market that I wanted to learn about. To me, getting a job was like learning a new skill on someone else’s dime. I was employed to try cool new things and if they didn’t work then I’d move on. If I could get more money somewhere else, I’d move on. If I didn’t particularly like my boss or co-workers, I’d move on. My dad definitely wanted me to forge ahead in a career and create a level of stability for my life, but stability is the enemy in my brain.  
I was fortunate that each job provided me with a bigger income than I deserved at the time. I was good in interviews and luckily giving a good interview meant getting good jobs and working with amazing people. The more I worked with incredible people, the more frustrated I became that some of them were happy working cushy jobs for big businesses and weren’t going it alone and changing the world by starting their own businesses. I used to feel that talent in a corporate is talent wasted. I don’t believe that any more because every entrepreneur needs to hire talent to work with them.  
Read the rest of this chapter while thinking about your own work experience, bosses, careers and colleagues while also thinking about why you are where you are. Maybe you don’t want to be there, maybe it’s time to move on or maybe you’re lucky to work with the people you work with.   
As much as I love building businesses, it’s not the only thing I’ve ever done. There are those entrepreneurs who have never worked for anyone in their lives and then there are those who have done both the corporate shuffle and the startup hustle. I’ve done a bit of corporate in my time.  
My first job was not at a big and bureaucratic corporate, it was at my old school. I went back to St David’s and got myself a part-time job as a coach. I coached cricket to a bunch of pretty average young sportsmen. Let me make this abundantly clear: I hate cricket. I don’t like watching it, I didn’t like playing it at school and I was never very good at it when I did play. How the hell I even managed to get a job coaching it is still a wonder to me. But coaching was it. Freelancing is tough and I needed to make a bit of cash on the side, so while I hunted for more writing work I would pitch up to school twice a week and on Saturdays for the matches and earn a bit of money.  
I have old schoolmates who did the same thing and never left school again. They studied for their undergrad degrees while coaching throughout their three-year course. They then did a teaching diploma and were employed by St David’s. I have no idea how they managed to do it. We’re clearly very different people, but after an afternoon with my team of budding cricketers I wanted to get drunk and pass out. Coaching is not for me.  
Pretty funny then that my next job was also a coaching job. When I was a teenager I was a pretty decent tennis player. I managed to rank in the top hundred players in SA at one point (very briefly) in my teens but when I went to high school I decided that cracking bones playing rugby was a more enticing choice. While I was coaching cricket at St David’s I decided to pick up some extra afternoons coaching tennis. I had not played tennis in about six years and needed a lesson myself, but onwards I went, coaching kids every other day.   
These two coaching jobs were OK money for about a year and if you throw in some freelance writing I was doing it all added up to a decent amount of money for a 21-year-old fresh out of university. But I was bored out of my mind and coaching does not really get my brain pumping or my ambitions fed. If I were a passionate coach who loved sports and enjoyed teaching teenagers to excel at their chosen sport then I’d have considered a career as a coach and tried to work my way up through the ranks. But I don’t have those ambitions and fortunately coaching tennis and cricket taught me that lesson very quickly. Luckily I don’t have a need to hang on to things and see them through to the end if it feels wrong. The way I see it is that work is the thing you’re going to spend most of your time doing (aside from sleeping) so you’d better enjoy it. It doesn’t have to be your passion but, at the very least, enjoy your work.

I’m definitely part of the job-hopping generation. The longest job that I held down was 18 months at Vodacom when I was 24\.  
Careers are different for everyone. Some people like stability and longevity. Some people like to innovate inside a corporate. Some people need a reliable income while others just don’t have it in them to start a company and risk it all. Some people want to throw everything they have – time, money or effort – at a crazy idea and see if it sticks. There’s no single path for everyone. There is no rule. There is also no right or wrong. Being an entrepreneur is not more admirable than working at a corporate in a job for 50 years. They appeal to different people. Imagine if we all wanted to start businesses ... who would work in them?  
I knew that I wanted to build things, so I went to whichever place I could learn the most from in the shortest amount of time. When I found something that suited my requirements better, I left. I was always looking for an angle to improve my skills and experience. This often meant making people angry. This also meant that I missed out on career defining roles with smart people. I therefore struggled to find stability and developed a reputation as a job-hopper. I didn’t actually mind any of these things at the time. I had an idea of what I wanted to do in my life and ultimately I was chasing the most exciting projects I could find that would help me move towards the goal of building the best business I could build. Starting projects and businesses while I was employed was my way of testing the things that I was learning.

## **702 TALK RADIO**

My corporate experience began at Radio 702\. At this point I was still studying journalism at Rhodes and part of our course requirement was real life job experience. I tapped into my Greek connections and discovered that 702 consisted of a fair number of Greeks. I interviewed with Katy Katopodis and under her guidance learned how to make a great cup of coffee at 5am to help the anchors and real journalists report the news. Katy also taught me how to be firm but fair. She was a god in the newsroom who did not suffer fools. This is tough to cope with when you are 19 and trying to figure out your place in the world, let alone your place in the newsroom. In case you are wondering, there is no place in the newsroom for interns. Your place is behind a cubicle with your ear pinned to the phone lines calling every police station every hour on the hour to see if there were any breaking arrests that you could report on. Not that much fun but pretty necessary back then.  
I spent a year on and off working at 702 with Katy, Regan Thaw, John Webb and many other gifted reporters. I was taught that the best way to do the best work is to work harder than anyone else and to do that more consistently than anyone else. That’s what made 702 the best place to get your news; they worked harder than any other news desk in the industry. As an intern, you worked with them or you moved on. I worked as hard as I could and still never made it onto the radio. Ironically I’ve gained more airtime being an entrepreneur than I ever would have if I had become a journalist. Real journalists are unique human beings and I’m not cut from that cloth.

## **12**

## **FREELANCING**

Once I left university, the logical thing to do was to find a job on the side so that I could continue building the startups that I had brought with me out of my time at Rhodes. There were a few startups, lots of excitement, but very little in the way of money. I had to earn and I had to earn fast.  
At this point, I did what any 21-year-old Greek boy would do. I moved in with my mother. She was kind enough to let me stay in the spare room while I worked at my startups and found a job.  
The very first thing I tried to do was become a freelance writer. I count freelancing as the first thing I tried to do on my own and build, like a business. It’s probably the most difficult thing that I ever attempted to start from scratch and build into something. There’s a lot of hard grind in freelancing. A lot of difficulty, selling, working, hustling and not a whole helluva lot of money.   
There was also a lot of rejection. I became quite comfortable with facing rejection. This is a skill that I developed and if I gained nothing else from freelancing then it was still time well spent.   
I was inexperienced and had absolutely no network. Not the kind of network that involves LinkedIn, Facebook DMs and a quick check on the job sites or Task Rabbit. I’m talking about the kind of network that builds and develops over years and through deep and meaningful relationships. Frivolous Facebook and LinkedIn networks mean very little in the real world.   
Being a freelance journalist back in 2004 meant that I had to get my ass down to the newsrooms, magazine offices, pubs, coffee shops and anywhere else I could think where editors would discover my skill.

The only real value that I found from my journalism degree was discovered in my hunt for work. The Rhodes University Alumni are spread throughout the South African media landscape and as soon as I discovered a fellow Rhodent (yes, that’s what they call us) I was a shoe-in for some work. I remember landing my first consistent bout of work in the small business section of the *Sunday Times* newspaper called ‘It’s My Business’ working for an editor and experienced journalist called Peter. He was everything you imagine an editor to be; scruffy beard, dishevelled hair, one too many buttons left undone on his shirt and a very haphazard approach to all things organisational. But, man alive, did he know how to write a story. And, holy shit, did I not.  
Something else that I learned about my degree in journalism was that you didn’t learn how to be a journalist by studying journalism. I learned everything I know today about writing by actually writing. Not from studying to write. Every editor I’ve ever had taught me how to be a better writer and storyteller.  
Here’s the thing about freelancing: it is fucking hard to pay your bills when you are being paid by the word as a young writer. Peter offered me an impressive R3 per word. It took me roughly a week to write, research, interview and submit a story. Do the math, folks, that’s R6 000 (±$500) a month. My profit margins did not work out and I could write only so many stories in a month with my level of experience. I didn’t realise it at the time but what I thought was a good setup actually turned out to be pretty tough to scale.

While working with Peter I had the chance to report on a story that I still consider to be an innovative model and one that influenced how I started NicHarry.com over a decade later.  
The 1000 for a 1000 initiative was a thing to behold. The idea was simple; fund 1000 small businesses in South Africa with R1 000 (±$85) and offer them free mentoring to help them turn that money into something meaningful. This was my first exposure to the concept of bootstrapping a business from almost nothing. R1 000 is not a lot of money and it’s extremely hard to do much of anything with R1 000\. Statistically most of these businesses were destined to fail but I reported on a few of them that made it and turned the R1 000 investment into R5 000 and then into R30 000 and then into a business that employed people. Amazing and inspiring stuff. I was still broke.  
From the very start, me being a freelancer was a broken business with a model that I didn’t like and couldn’t scale. I was a capitalist with ambition and freelancing just wasn’t satisfying my hunger for knowledge and growth (and cash). Imagine a law firm but the lawyer can charge only R3 an hour. There’s no business there in my eyes. Same with my freelancing career. It was a bust. There are many people who love freelancing but I’m not one of them. It’s not a career or lifestyle that I wanted back then or want right now. It’s a great fit for many people around the world and I respect the hell out of anyone who can make it work, but freelancing is filled with problems that I didn’t want to take on. I wanted the problems that came with building a business.

## ***FINANCIAL MAIL*** **& *BUSINESS DAY***

Big business moves slowly and media is no different. I left the ‘It’s My Business’ section and thanks to an ex-business partner and friend, Christof, I found a job as the editor of *Financial Mail*’s Campus magazine called *FM Campus*. At *FM Campus* I learned some interesting things, but overall it was a job like just about any other job in media at the time. There were deadlines, writers, photos, designers and everything else you’d expect at a magazine.   
I thought that I needed to make my stamp on the job and the magazine so my big move was to help *FM* and the *FM Campus* shift online. We launched new websites while I was there and blogs and attempted podcasts (yes, there were podcasts before 2016). I played to my strengths and those were heavily weighted towards the digital side of media. I was pretty hopeless at understanding the distribution numbers of the actual hard copy magazine which is where the advertisers were and where the money was coming from. I didn’t really do much to improve the guts of the business. I was fixated on the easy stuff again. Much like my previous methodology, I was working on aesthetics when the core business model was flailing. We redesigned the *FM Campus* cover and content sections. This was a way for me to impress my own personality upon the magazine. I found new writers to bring a different voice to the publication but, much like *Activate* at Rhodes, students were not interested in news, especially financially focused longform magazine pieces. No matter how you try to spin it, selling heavy text based magazines to students was a difficult business.  
I learned a lot from my editors at *Financial Mail*. The main thing that these incredible journalists get right is a voracious appetite for the truth. They could smell a lie from across the country. When they thought there was a story they would attack it with relentless focus. At the time, Barney Mthombothi was the editor of *FM* but one of the senior reporters, Stuart Theobold, was the person who managed me while I was the editor of the *FM Campus* magazine. Stuart was a firm but fair boss. He was calm until there was cause to not be calm. He was detail orientated and did not accept anything substandard. These are characteristics that I found in all the great bosses that I’ve had. Being the editor of a magazine also teaches you to pick up the phone and make a call without hesitation to just about anyone. Interviewing some of the most respected economists, business leaders and thinkers in South Africa is a breeze when you have a deadline in 30 minutes and need just one quote for the cover story. You just do it because if you don’t the magazine doesn’t go to print on time and you lose money. A lot of it.  
As the editor of the *FM Campus* I had to write my monthly editorial. I was 22 and had to write an editorial about things that I just didn’t really understand. I was faking it and learning as I went along. If you remember reading any of those editorials, I apologise now for how thin they were on detail.  
Strangely, writing an editorial was probably the most difficult thing to do while I was putting out the *FM Campus* every month. It’s easy to rally other people to hit their deadlines. It’s easy to discuss what other writers are focusing on, who they’re talking to and how far they are from complete. But my editorial was always the very last piece of content that was handed in to the design team. Why? Because I am not particularly good with deadlines. This is a common misconception about journalists. Everyone assumes two things about us as a breed:

1. We know how to spell. We do not. We have sub-editors for that.  
2. We know how to manage deadlines. We do not. We know how to squash as much work as possible as close to the deadline as possible with as little sleep as possible to get the job done.

Point \#2 is called Parkinson’s Law. It’s a theory about work filling the time allocated to it. It states that ‘work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion’. This perfectly describes every single journalist I’ve ever met. If you give us one day or three months to hit a deadline we will hit the deadline exactly on time, every time. No early delivery, not ever.  
Unsurprisingly, my editorial and small aesthetic changes did nothing for the magazine’s sales as we literally struggled to give the magazine away. However, we did begin to see some uptake online which was promising. Frustratingly, this online engagement was not enough for me to get any real budget to grow the online side of the business. It’s a pretty typical scenario in businesses today; the thing that makes the most money right now receives the most budget to operate and grow. The things that might make the business future-proof and keep the numbers up isn’t making money right now so it doesn’t receive sufficient budget to grow. My friend Rich Mulholland calls this *Legacide* and has written an entire book about the topic.  
Legacy thinking was poison (and still is) in media companies the world over. None of my editors were willing to take the leap and really take digital seriously and make it the centre of their strategy. This is the reason that I began to fall out of love with the media industry and journalism in the broader sense. I didn’t want to write newspaper articles or magazine columns that had limited reach and limited potential. I wanted to engage with the world on this new thing called the Internet. I wanted to experiment. I wanted to do more.   
While at *FM* I was exposed to the broader *Business Day* and *Financial Mail* (BDFM) businesses and eventually found myself sitting next to the head of online for BDFM. At this point in history people who were becoming ‘head of digital’ at any publication were irrelevant in the greater scheme of digital development and innovation. They were pushed into jobs they didn’t really understand or want from positions in old media environments. It’s not relevant to tell you who the head of digital was at BDFM at the time because they really didn’t make much of an imprint on me or the business. I tried extremely hard for 12 months to work at BDFM and bring them blogs, a newly designed website, innovative thinking around news media and how to catch up with the global trend of digital media, but I failed dismally to make a dent in the mindset of the ancient thinking held by the people running the show.  
There was barely a media team in the country that understood the potential of the Internet ... except for the folks at *Mail & Guardian*.

## **THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS**

I was never a big reader of contracts. I would cowboy it all the way to the signature page and then scribble my name, the date and the place. Employment contracts, gym contracts, business contracts, you name it, I would sign it without hesitation.   
This is a massively stupid way to approach life. Whether you want to believe it or not, contracts are enforceable and usually (always) by the person with either the most money or the most to lose. I’ve experienced both the desperate and the wealthy in my entrepreneurial career and neither is pleasant. Employment contracts are tough to navigate. When you are accepting a job, you want to be grateful and not ruin the opportunity by pushing back too hard on the terms of the contract. However if you don’t read the contract then you probably won’t know what rules you’re breaking while you are breaking them. If you are an employer and writing your contracts I urge you to write them in plain language and consult with an HR expert to help you write something that is fair, obvious and simple. Don’t try to screw your employees because often they are your only asset when everything else is falling to shit.   
As a rule I’ve always believed that if you have to refer to a contract to understand how to proceed then it’s very likely that the relationship has soured already and you need serious intervention to salvage the relationship or end it. This is exactly what happened to me while I was working at Avusa (Avusa was the holding company that owned *The Times*, BDFM and a slew of other publications at the time). I just couldn’t help myself and started a side hustle.   
In the midst of my time working to publish a monthly magazine and drag *Business Day* and *Financial Mail* (BDFM) into the future I started a gadget review website with two friends. Why did I start a gadget review blog? I wanted to review the latest gadgets, obviously. The iPhone was about to launch, iPods had just become a thing, PlayStation was doing cool shit and I wanted in. I didn’t know how to get my hands on these gadgets. I couldn’t afford to buy them. So I did what I knew how to do: set up a blog and write.   
Gregor (yep, the same Gregor from StudentWire days), Justin and I started Nudjit.com. Nudjit was a tech review blog for the South African market. There really weren’t any websites for geeks by geeks in South Africa that reviewed the latest gadgets, tech platforms, laptops, cameras and gaming consoles. We decided that since we were involved in the media space, actual journalists and technologists as well as geeks, Nudjit was the perfect startup to start up. I was working at *FM* and Gregor and Justin were both working at the new media and innovation division of the group. We would meet on our coffee breaks to smoke, talk shop, and plan the next product reviews.   
We managed to build up a nifty little blog within a few short months. Justin was a fantastic developer who built the project and Gregor and I helped with design and reviews as we went along. I spent time gathering tech partners for us to engage with to receive the latest gadgets and games and such and we began to gain traction. There was a clear and present requirement for a local tech and gadget community so we received PR from all kinds of websites and news outlets across South Africa and Kenya. We wanted to build this site quickly and get traffic, grow our base and do all of this inside of our jobs at Avusa. Not surprisingly, there was no budget for this sort of project. There was also no interest, it wasn’t on the roadmap and if you can think of another corporate cliché that equates to ‘no’, then we were fed it. So you can imagine that to me that means: do it yourself. So we just did it.   
However, Justin, Gregor and I very quickly learned a hard lesson about working at a corporate and building anything of your own. You can’t do it. It’s not allowed contractually. If you work at a corporate or an organised business of any kind, take a moment right now to get your contract out and see if you have a clause in there that stipulates that whatever you build on company time or with company tools (laptop, cellphone, car, etc) is owned by the company. That’s what caught us out. Big time. Since Gregor and Justin were tasked with innovation in the business, their boss argued that this is the sort of project they should have built for their employer.  
We were lucky that Avusa decided to buy Nudjit from us instead of forcing us to shut it down. We were even luckier not to be fired. The price that we were paid for our gadget review blog was R40 000\. I had officially sold my first tiny little startup to The Man. I had to sign a three-month non-compete and gave up a fledgling startup but it was worth it because I wasn’t sued or fired.

## **IT’S GOOD TO GET CRAPPED ON SOMETIMES**

I left *Financial Mail* because I was poached to join the *Mail & Guardian*’s shit hot digital team as the head of mobile. I wasn’t entirely sure what this meant but after enough time in the slow-moving world of print media I was ready to commit my future to technology in any form.  
I was poached from *FM* by V. The same Vincent who was one of the lecturers at Rhodes, the guy who helped me build StudentWire and the same guy who helped me secure Virgin Money as a sponsor for SA Rocks. We were reunited in a work environment for the first time since we left Rhodes. We stayed in contact after I started up SA Rocks and when he realised that I was frustrated at *FM* decided that it was time to get me involved in the innovative *MG* team. The team at the time was headed up by a well-known personality in the digital media landscape in South Africa called Matt. Matt is an intelligent and driven guy with a mean streak in him and an aggressive approach to business who would quickly teach me a very important lesson.  
My career at *Mail & Guardian* was short but intense. I was there for no more than six months. I was thrown into the middle of an entire digital redesign at *MG* that involved technical redevelopment of both online and mobile platforms as well as completely new front end designs for the user/reader. We spent countless hours redesigning, tweaking, testing and hustling to hit the go-live date that we had set.   
We were creating an innovative new blogging platform called Thought Leader that involved recruiting some of the most accomplished people in the country to write for us. I was tasked with calling as many of them as possible. Cold calling is tough enough but cold calling Bruce Fordyce, Francois Pienaar and other sports, business and political people is intense. We didn’t pay these incredible people to write for us. I managed to sell them on the esteem of becoming an *MG* writer. This was a huge accomplishment and Thought Leader took off.  
At the time, Vincent and Matt had both recently become parents and they were pretty focused on balancing their lives. They would pack their stuff at 4pm and head home to bathe their kids. I admired this. We could work hard and then go home. It wasn’t always like this though. When there was a go-live date looming we had to pull many all-nighters. I remember sitting behind my computer and copy/paste/editing hundreds and hundreds of old urls to the new structure we were implementing which would be better for search engines. It was tough and brain-numbing work but Matt remembered to thank us with pizza and beer whenever we needed it. Overall it was a good place to be.  
Then I became greedy.  
While working day and night with the *MG* team to get the new site live I was also in talks with a startup called Zoopy to see if I could get them to host *MG* video on their platform. My conversation with Jason, the founder of Zoopy, quickly turned into a negotiation for a job at the startup and Jason offered to double my *MG* salary if I moved over and became the Zoopy General Manager in Johannesburg.  
The job description was unclear but the money was good and this was a move out of corporate into the land of startups.  
I accepted the job and then had to resign. I had no idea what was coming my way.  
I walked into Matt’s office and told him that I was resigning. He sat back, paused and then laid into me like I’ve never experienced before or since. Matt told me that I would live to regret leaving his team. That this was the worst decision I would ever make and that I shouldn’t expect to work with or for him ever again. I walked out of that room a shattered and shat-on man. I also walked out with a little less respect for Matt than when I had walked in.  
That day Matt taught me an important lesson: if someone wants to leave, let them go. Don’t be emotional. Don’t shout at them. Don’t call them names. Don’t threaten them because you don’t know what the future looks like. I like to think that Matt understands now that shouting was probably not the best way to handle the situation and I imagine he wouldn’t do it again if he had the choice.   
Many years later at one of my businesses, I shouted at one of my team in much the same way as Matt had shouted at me. He wasn’t resigning but had irritated me to the point where I just lost it. I was not pleasant. Having once been on the receiving end of a scream of that magnitude meant that I had a little bit of perspective. A few minutes after I had stopped shouting and hung up the phone, I called the team member back and apologised for talking to him like that. It’s OK to make mistakes as long as you are learning from them. I was lucky enough to learn from Matt’s mistakes. Sometimes it’s OK to experience something, learn from it and still repeat the same thing later on in life. No one is perfect, the difference between me shouting at my team member and Matt shouting at me is that I called and immediately apologised. It’s what I would have wanted from Matt at the time and what I hope I’ll continue to do going forward.

## **ZOOPY DOOPY DOO**

I joined Zoopy shortly after my abrupt end at *MG*. Vincent also left *MG* at around the same time and went to work at Vodacom South Africa. Zoopy was a video hosting platform that was shifting into a media production company. The company struggled with a core vision and wasn’t sure about what it did to make money. This made my job complicated. The business’s head office was in Cape Town and I was tasked with hiring my own team and building up my own office in Johannesburg. I was given a pretty large budget to do this and a fair amount of freedom which I don’t think I acknowledged or used effectively at the time.  
My time at Zoopy was short-lived, much like my time at *Mail & Guardian*. I was there for less than a year and in that time I think I was quite a difficult person to work with. I was in my early twenties and had a massive chip on my shoulder for no particular reason. The CEO, Jason, gave me a big budget, a lot of freedom and an already established business to grow and I think I just didn’t know what to do with all of that responsibility. I talked a big game but ultimately had absolutely no experience at setting up an office, hiring a team or starting to sell a product.   
I began hunting for a team of content producers. The concept was pretty simple; Zoopy would not only host the content produced by our users (like YouTube does) but we would also produce news and entertainment content so that our users would want to continue to visit the platform for more slick and professional content (like Netflix does). I found a team of journalists with skill in producing and editing video content.   
At this point in my career the little chip on my shoulder had become a large bag of chips that I carried around on my back like a massive burden. The unfortunate victim of my frustration was Zoopy and the management team in Cape Town. Starting a regional office is difficult at the best of times, as I would learn later on in my entrepreneurial career. I butted heads with Jason and constantly blamed them for making it too hard to build my team and succeed. I was missing targets, missing deadlines and mostly spending budget that I was allocated. I’m surprised at how naive I was about budget while at Zoopy. We acted like a typically well-funded Silicon Valley startup, spending money on well-decorated offices, with big graphics on the walls, large spaces in high-rental areas and ping-pong tables to keep people happy. We were focused on spending our budget in the wrong places. Today, if I were to spend money on frivolous things that made no material difference to the bottom line so early on, I think I’d be very disappointed in myself. Back then, however, I was happy to find chairs for our boardroom that cost R1 200 (±$100) each and were intentionally uncomfortable so meetings weren’t too long.   
In my experience, working with startup founders is difficult if you are equally as strong-willed as they are or have your own vision for their business. Founders are a tricky bunch. It’s their way or no way. It’s their name behind the business, it’s their reputation on the line and it’s their responsibility to make things work. The buck stops with the founder and that means that their vision is the one that counts. Ultimately Zoopy was not my business and I had my own view of how things should be. I made the founding team the enemy in my mind and as soon as that happened I was mentally checked out.   
Then one day Vincent called me up and asked me if I wanted to join him at Vodacom because he thought I’d be a good fit. He also thought that things at Zoopy weren’t great and that my talents would be better suited with him. It was a no-brainer to move to Vodacom.  
The world was moving into a mobile first space. South Africa had skipped the desktop and laptop computer trends and was quickly becoming one of the leading mobile countries in the world. Vodacom had money, Vincent had budget and we could build amazing things for millions of users. My time at Zoopy was difficult and I wasn’t happy working there. I wasn’t the CEO, I had no control and, honestly, even if I did have control I can’t be sure I would have known what to do with it. I was clashing with Jason and convinced myself that it was better for everyone if I left.   
I asked for a ridiculous salary and got it so I moved without a second thought.

## **A REAL JOB**

Vodacom brought me the biggest learnings, biggest budget and most users in my short corporate career. I could blow hundreds of thousands of rand buying ads and if they didn’t work we wouldn’t be fired, we’d just try again next month because almost no one would notice the money had been spent. Sure, if that happened for a year I’d get fired but even that prospect never bothered me because I could always just get another job. Everything was supercharged at Vodacom \- the size of the projects, the budgets, the teams, the targets and everything else. There were no small measures.   
Before I took the Vodacom job I had coffee with a friend of mine because I was scouting for opportunities. Mike said that the head of marketing position was available at Samsung. At the time I was about 23 years old and could not fathom being competent enough to become the head of anything, let alone Samsung’s marketing department. Mike did not give me fresh advice but the advice he did give me really made an imprint on my perspective of the world at the time.   
Mike told me to fake it. He said that I was a fast enough learner to get hired and figure it out on the job. At the time I was overwhelmed by the idea of faking it into such a high level position so I didn’t even go for the interview, but the cliché that you should fake it till you make it really holds true in my life.   
I like to say that it’s best to live at the forefront of incompetence. To me, that statement means that you can live in a place where you know just enough to learn what you don’t know. The key is to be good at learning and adopting those lessons quickly while you are building something. There’s a startup saying that you should jump off a cliff and build the plane on the way down. That’s how you should look at a new job, a new city, a new partner or anything that you are scared to do: jump off the cliff and figure out the rest on your way down. That’s what I did at Vodacom, starting with my interview.   
Every job I have ever received, bar none, has been through my network and personal endorsements. I’ve never interviewed cold for a position, not once. The job that I took at Vodacom was no different. I had worked with Vincent for a few years on and off at this point and he again popped up and suggested that I move to Vodacom and join his team in the newly formed social media department where they were building out a new social network called The Grid. I was interested so I met with him and his boss for an informal interview.   
Jose sat in his corner office at his corporate desk on his nice comfy corporate chair while Vincent and I sat across from him. He looked way too young to be heading up a major department at the largest mobile network in South Africa, but here he was in South Africa after progressing his career through the Vodafone companies and other mobile networks in Africa and Europe. Jose didn’t care about my CV or my qualifications. I assumed he had read my CV but ultimately he had one question that I needed to answer: why would he hire such a young person to take on such a big role at Vodacom?   
These are the types of questions that win me jobs in interviews. It was never the ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?’ or the ‘What’s your best/worst attribute?’ that got me the job. The answer to Jose’s question was a simple one that stemmed from the advice Mike had given me a few months earlier. I told Jose (almost verbatim) that I was the best person for the job regardless of my age because I would work harder than anyone to learn and become the best at this job.  
That was it. I was honest and I walked out of his office with the job. 

Working at Vodacom had its perks. Perks like a big salary, access to resources and access to a massive database of users. But it also had its flaws. Too many meetings, too many corporate slobs who booked those meetings so that they could appear to be busy, too much red tape that prevents you from moving fast and breaking things and too many people trying to get promoted instead of building amazing things. To avoid the many, many meetings that we were pulled into, Vincent and I began booking out our own diaries with meetings with each other. Your meeting calendar was public at Vodacom so that anyone could see when you were available and book you into a meeting. Saying no to a meeting was never really an option, so instead we just booked our own time so we could do actual work and not sit in useless meetings keeping careered employees busy.   
Building The Grid was an interesting project for me to work on. The Grid was a location based social network for your phone. So you could sign up using your phone’s web browser and our website. Then we’d use your phone’s GPS to figure out where you were and then we’d show you other people in your location that you might want to connect with. It was a mishmash of Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare back in 2008/9 and it was targeted at the developing market where these Western services hadn’t really grown yet and smartphones weren’t pervasive. Vodacom was trying to grab market share before the big guys entered the market. Vincent and I were given big budgets, big teams and lofty goals. We spent days and days planning how to grow this platform into something worthwhile.   
At the time Vincent and I both smoked a lot of cigarettes so we would move our cubicle conversations out into the smoking section of the Vodacom building and work in the shade while smoking one cigarette after the other. At the time, everything was urgent, major, massive, immediate and dramatic. We had user goals set by our higher-ups and financial targets set by their higher-ups. It was typically corporate in its nature and structure. The people defining success on the battlefield had no clue what success looked like or what the soldiers were doing on the frontlines.  
The fantastic thing about building a startup inside of a corporate is that there’s very little personal pressure. That was something that I would learn only once I left Vodacom, raised money and built a startup of my own at scale. We managed to grow The Grid to over 1 million users in a year and shortly afterwards reached 1.8 million users on the platform, but in truth it just wasn’t enough. The technical restriction of mobile web and Internet access in South Africa made it a tough ask to get users to do much of anything. The smartphone revolution hadn’t really kicked in yet, especially not in Africa, and web browsers were all we had to work with. The difficult thing about working at a business as big as Vodacom is that very little that you do actually moves the needle and that can be infuriating. Even if we had hit 5 million users and were making R10 million a month in revenue that wouldn’t have been a major milestone for Vodacom. At one point Vincent and I worked out that our entire two-year budget to build and promote The Grid was the equivalent of eight hours of revenue at Vodacom. That’s heartbreaking to realise when you’re slaving away building something and giving it your all. When I got to grips with this factoid it was a turning point for me. I realised that working at a big corporate was never going to fulfil me. I was building something big and meaningful and it didn’t matter to my bosses or their bosses or the shareholders. The technology wasn’t relevant to them, only the turnover mattered. That was it for me mentally, I had checked out and was on the hunt for the next thing.   
There’s a very key principle here; pressure and rewards are intimately tied together. If the pressure is high and the rewards match the pressure then the chances are you’ll be interested in pushing through the tough times to reap the rewards. At a big corporate there is definitely less pressure and a lot more money available; however, the actual rewards on offer aren’t as significant as in a startup where you probably own equity in the business and have a massive upside if things go well. At Vodacom, profit really mattered a lot less to us in an immediate sense. We had big budgets to build product and acquire users. Ironically, if we were gunning for profit that we would have benefitted from directly there was more chance we’d have grown The Grid into a formidable product over time for Vodacom.  
Fortunately I didn’t leave Vodacom too soon because we started to work on an extremely interesting project that dovetailed with The Grid. We used the technology that we had developed at The Grid to build out a massive multiplayer online location based mobile game. We called it Legends of Echo (LoE). The premise was simple. Using your account with The Grid, you would sign up to play LoE and then find players near your location to battle. This project was technologically massive. We had a team of 20 or 30 developers working to build out the website and gameplay. We hired a designer to re-map the entire country with game visuals that made it feel like a battleground wherever you were. Each actual mall, office block or house in South Africa had its own digital version where you could keep your spoils and battle people. This was to be my final project at Vodacom, but it was an interesting one to end off with.   
We launched LoE by hosting small dinner gatherings for media and gamers where we introduced the game using actual playing cards of the characters you could choose from. I still have a pack of those cards. The media loved it and so did the players. In the first month we signed up 5 000 new players who were all using their airtime to engage with other players, battle, win or lose and then play again. We definitely had a hit. But the big bosses did not feel the same. This was a divergence from our focus on The Grid and even that wasn’t hitting their user or revenue targets. The writing was on the wall.   
Vodacom, our bosses and our advertising spend were starting to wear thin. Here’s the thing about building something new and innovative inside of a large corporate with big shareholders who all want to get rich; you have to help them increase share price. That’s the bottom line. Without that there’s no real interest. Big businesses struggle to innovate because of their dependence on the existing business models. Spending money on something new over a long period of time with planned losses is tough to swallow.   
Vodacom is not like Uber, a business that has raised billions of dollars and is losing billions of dollars every quarter. Uber is prepared for losses, they invested in growth over profit. Amazon has worked tirelessly for decades on minimising their shareholder dividends and company profit so that they could reinvest in technology, scale innovation and grow new areas of their business. Vodacom was not that business. Vodacom executives had cushy salaries and were scared of risk. They were equally scared of anything innovative that might disrupt their department or require a meeting that might not be a waste of time.   
Seeing all of these things really did shape the way I wanted to build a business. Working at a large corporate like Vodacom showed me what I did not want for my own business. It also helped me gain the confidence to leave my cushy job and strike out on my own.

While at Vodacom I fell into some of the most obvious social traps that exist in today’s time. I bought a house, a fancy car and blew most of my salary every month on stupid things like parties, dinners and garden flowers. This is possibly my single biggest regret from my time at Vodacom. I had enough money to build up a solid investment portfolio and instead of taking the time to learn about how to do that, I did what everyone else was doing. The house I bought turned out to be a lemon. It took me over a year to sell it once I had moved out and I stupidly rented it out to my family who didn’t pay me enough rent. That was a big financial mistake. Buying a car that cost me a stupid amount of money every month was the next stupid thing that I did with my salary. I don’t care about cars at all. I care about getting to and from places, but when you live in a city like Johannesburg you are pulled into the competition to see who has the fancier car. Everyone loses that competition, by the way.   
Luckily I was on my way out of my corporate job and grinding my way into a new startup with V. That was the end of my corporate employment ambitions. It’s almost impossible to avoid working *with* big business and slow-moving corporates, but it is absolutely possible to never work *for* one. The next seven years of my life are the ones that would define me, break me, make me, rebuild me and break me again. The next two businesses that I built would teach me more than all the previous years in my life combined.

## **SHUT UP AND BUILD IT**

If you are reading this book and have an idea that you want to turn into a business then let me ask you: why are you not building your business right now?  
Building my next business, Motribe, was one of the most challenging and draining experiences of my entrepreneurial life. Some of it was good, much of it was bad, all of it was stressful.   
There are a lot of answers to the ‘Why not just build it?’ question. They include: because it’s risky, because I am scared, because everyone thinks I’m crazy, because I have expenses to pay, because I have kids, because I don’t know how, because I’ve never done it before, because I have no funding, and many others. These are all great reasons not to build your idea into something more than an idea. These are also really shitty excuses because there are many entrepreneurs who have children, husbands, bonds to pay, car payments, fears and apprehensions.   
The difference between those who build and those who dream is the ‘do’ part. In his fantastic book, *Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World*, Adam Grant talks about quantity over quality when it comes to success. The premise is really simple: Mozart did not write a single piece of music that became a resounding success and retire a wealthy man. Mozart wrote hundreds of pieces of music and many of them were masterpieces that made him famous but most of them were regular pieces of music that were forgettable and forgotten by history. Shakespeare did not write *Macbeth* as a stand-alone piece of genius. He wrote it alongside some of the worst plays that he had ever written. The point here is that these geniuses *did* more than most. They *wrote* more than most. They *practised* more than most. They *published* more than most and in so *doing* they refined their craft. They shut up and did things. They lived action words like did, wrote, practised, published and built. They did not *think* about building, doing, writing, they *did* them.   
When it comes to businesses or ideas, for some odd reason we believe that we have one shot. We have to make it work right now with this one chance, or we’ll never get another shot at it. I have never felt this way about building things. I build them when I have the urge to build them. I have spent years refining my skill set to allow me to prototype ideas in the simplest way possible. This is called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Eric Ries has written a great book about doing things in the leanest way possible, it’s called *The Lean Startup* and if you haven’t read it yet, you probably should. He was one of the first people to talk openly about doing the simplest version of your business possible to test it in the market.   
This is key, getting your product out into the world. You know what you can’t really test in the real world? An idea. You have no clue how the world is going to actually use the product you want to build. You have no idea how a market is going to react to something you put out into the world. You think you know, but you have no clue. Every time I’ve launched something expecting a certain result I have been partially wrong and had to shift expectation and strategy to accommodate the way people perceive and use things. The truth is, you cannot imagine your ideas into the world. You have to produce them. You have to make them tangible and you have to get the tangible product into the world.   
	  
V and I realised that our enthusiasm and talents were being wasted at Vodacom. Corporates are slow to act, short on budget and lack vision. We needed to do something else. We wanted to do something bigger than earning more money for already stinking rich people who don’t care about their customers or the world.   
Remembering the lessons that I had learned from being forced to sell Nudjit to Avusa a few years earlier, Vincent and I began to discuss how we were going to start our own business without getting screwed while we continued to work at Vodacom.   
V is a grinder. He can build and launch a prototype or beta version of a product faster than just about anyone I’ve ever worked with.   
At the end of 2009 Vincent had created a prototype of a mobile social network for emo kids called emofwendz.com. It was a simple mobile web based social network, like Facebook, but only for kids who identified as emo. This little network gained traction quickly and with very little advertising spend. Vincent and I realised that we were onto something. Niche mobile social networks.   
It just so happened that over that December period in 2009 I was going on holiday with Jen and her friends. I was set to work on this idea, come hell or high water. It was hell. I was extremely unhappy with my life at the time. I didn’t like my job and wasn’t happy with Jen as a result. When I was in my twenties my problems were always caused by someone else. In this case it was Jen.  
I spent my days on Google chat with Vincent while everyone else was at the beach. I polished off half a bottle of Southern Comfort before lunch while Vincent and I worked on emofwendz and the platform we believed would allow us to build many more of these niche social networks. The thinking was pretty simple: if the emo kids loved their niche network then surely there were more niches that we could build and grow. What if we even allowed people to join and build their own niches, not defined by us? Perhaps that’s where the magic was hidden.  
This platform would become Motribe – a mobile social network builder.   
The Ballito holiday with Jen came to an aggressive end with a really shitty New Year’s Eve party. I didn’t want to be where I was, no one else wanted me to be there either and I was really unpleasant to be around. At this point in my life I believed that life had to suffer in the name of work. No matter how much I drank I couldn’t escape the fact that I was still right there in my own mind with or without the alcoholic haze that I forced into my brain. I returned back from holiday no happier, not well rested, with a broken relationship and a business that was about to take shape.    
Once back at Vodacom and in the same city, Vincent and I would spend our mornings and evenings meeting and engaging about how we were going to build this platform, fund it and when we were going to go at it full time. 

The first thing we needed was a name. You know how everyone believes that they have a secret talent? You have one, I’m sure. Whether it’s spinning a pen around on your finger really well, drawing a perfect circle, juggling, handstands or whatever, we all believe we have a strange and random gift. I seem to have a gift for naming things.   
As I sat in my Vodacom cubicle I was thinking about a name for the mobile social network platform that we wanted to build and it suddenly hit me with an almost literal jolt. We’re building places for tribes of people to gather on their mobile phones. We’re building mobile tribes. Motribe.  
I told Vincent and he loved it but he insisted that the Motribe.com domain would not be available. Before he could finish his sentence I had purchased Motribe.com for $11. We were in business and it cost me only $11.   
At this time in 2009/10 the tech world was on fire. Twitter had raised $35 million, Facebook was exploding globally, mobile phones were the talk of the town and Africa was a focal point as an untapped market that was about to become tapped by everyone. Opera Mini was making inroads into the mobile networks. Vincent and I had just helped Facebook and Twitter launch lite versions of their services on the Vodacom network using SMS. Everyone in the world was talking tech. This was a time when you could raise venture capital funding off the back of a decent business plan with no working prototype or traction.   
We had emofwendz.com, real users, actual traction and domain expertise.   
Let’s quickly pause here and talk about domain expertise.   
When you are out raising capital, something that investors like to see is how well suited you are to build your company in the industry you have chosen. For example: have you been farming for ten years if you want to disrupt the farming industry? Are you a bus driver who has built an app for bus drivers? That sort of thing.   
At the time, domain expertise counted for a lot as there were very few mobile experts who had domain expertise in the African market, who had grown a social network and worked on mobile gamification to gain users and retain them. Acknowledging that you have domain expertise is tricky.   
South Africans are not arrogant or self-promoting by nature. We’re a humble bunch. We like other people to point out that we’re good at something and then deny it. These sorts of compliments help us to help ourselves. But this approach does not help you raise money. If you are going into a meeting with potential investors and you expect them to illustrate your domain expertise and acknowledge your skill set, you are kidding yourself. There are literally hundreds of people with your CV, your experience and your skill set. What we had to illustrate was that our combination of experience, drive, passion and ability to execute made us a force to be invested in. Feeling like an impostor is a daily occurrence when raising money. You constantly question your ability, your pitch, your relationship with your co-founder and your ability to execute. There is a lot of doubt. It’s constant, it’s real and it can be debilitating.    
V and I were the perfect founding pair to pitch to investors: An experienced technical talent and a young, driven, focused sales and marketing guy.   
We had everything we needed to go out and raise funding.   
Looking back on this particular time with the gift of hindsight, I can see alarm bells ringing already. I was young and keen to strike out on my own and make a name for myself. Vincent had already made a name for himself with ten years’ more work experience than I had and was openly reluctant to leave the corporate world, a safe pay cheque and the stability that he had created. He insisted that for us to work on this project any longer than we had already, we needed to raise funding and secure our salaries. No salary, no business.   
Starting a business is tough. It’s not about the salary. Today I am earning less than half of what I was earning at Motribe or Vodacom. Salaries are not the point. A big salary isn’t the goal at a startup. However, when you have a child and a wife, stability and security matter. 

So we started to fund-raise.

## **THE FIRST FUND-RAISE**

Raising money for a business seems to be all the rage. Whichever news portal you are reading will try to sell the idea that venture capital is the be all and end all of business goals (today it’s more likely an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) than venture capital that’s all over your feed). Raise money, grow rapidly, list your company on the stock exchange and cash in, baby\! What a dream\! Sure, that’s one way to look at venture capital. There are, however, many ways to look at raising money and the beginning of it all should centre around your particular business.   
If you take anything away from this section of my book it’s this: the best kind of funding is profit. Before you think about raising money from somewhere ask yourself: ‘How do we become profitable, fast?’  
There is no one size fits all solution for raising money. I have raised money for businesses that should have been slow growth, high profit entities and ended up dying. I have friends who have raised money because they wanted the investor’s expertise on their side. I have met entrepreneurs who have raised money, built businesses and then taken out bank loans to buy their investors out of the business. Imagine wanting so badly to get rid of your investors that you would rather be indebted to a bank\! These are some alternative truths behind the glamour of raising money.   
At Motribe there were two occasions when I was raising money. The first was before we really launched our platform. This is the kind of fund-raise that you do after hours and on holidays while you have a full-time job and are trying to get buy-in from investors so you can leave your job and rather focus on your business full time. The second fundraise was meant to be a growth round of funding. This would actually turn out to be a survival round of funding as time wore on and our growth stagnated. This type of fund-raising takes over your life and your work. You become the founder who raises money, not the founder who builds a business. There’s a stark difference between building a business, running a business and raising funding for a business. They all require different skills and different focus. To attempt to do all three simultaneously was a massive mistake. I hope you read on and learn from my mistakes.   
Here’s what I knew about funding and financing a business when we started with Motribe: nothing. Having returned the investment for Digspot I was completely in over my head. The anxiety is overwhelming when you are taking a new idea to a person who appears to be experienced and intelligent and asking them, hat in hand, for money. Why would they invest in me? They don’t know me. I don’t deserve it. There are smarter people with better ideas in the world. This probably won’t work. I can’t make this work. Someone else can make this work but not me. But here’s the thing about building something: you don’t have a choice. There is no choice but to put yourself out there. If you aren’t putting yourself out there, raising the money, building the business, selling it and diving in then there’s probably a good reason for it. Perhaps you’re not ready (I was never ready for any business I built), you might not really believe in your idea, you might not trust your partner, your timing might be wrong, whatever. But if you aren’t talking about and building your idea then you need to really think about why. 

Back in 2010 there were very few places to find venture capital in South Africa. Venture capital is different from getting a loan from a bank. Banks generally will not invest in high risk projects or businesses and they will not do so as an equity deal. They give you a loan and you pay it back over time. This is a very normal and perfectly acceptable way of raising funding. Many businesses have raised money this way. Nike, for one, used their bank loans to great and dramatic effect, raising up to $1 000 000 a month to carry their cash flow and would then pay the bank back through the month through sales of their sneakers.   
South African banks probably wouldn’t have given us money for a mobile social network builder and, to be honest, I didn’t even bother to ask.   
In 2009, Cape Town entrepreneur Justin Stanford founded the Silicon Cape initiative with another entrepreneur, Vinny Lingham. Vinny had just raised a $20 million funding round for his website builder, Synthasite (which would go on to be renamed Yola).  
V and I had both attended the Silicon Cape launch event and when we thought of VC in South Africa, Justin’s name was at the top of the list. 

We started to build our business model (really just a document talking about a prototype we had already built) in January 2010 and immediately contacted Justin through Facebook, as one does when trying to raise millions in funding.   
Incredibly, Justin responded that he was interested in meeting with us. We didn’t give him too much detail as we were playing it cool and trying to build a relationship before hitting him up for the funding we desperately needed to break free of the Vodacom shackles.   
There was one small catch. Justin was in Cape Town and Vincent and I both lived in Johannesburg.   
V and I organised a trip down to Cape Town and set up a meeting with Justin at his place. It sounds flippant when I say ‘his place’, but his place was a penthouse suite at the Cape Royale in Green Point. Just like in the movies, we took the elevator up to the roof of the hotel and sat on the pool deck while we waited for Justin.   
He arrived wearing his now trademark flip-flops, white collared polo shirt and long-shorts that went past his knees. Justin is a very calm guy and was extremely engaged in our idea and our plans. He had done research on our industry and was keen to hear our take on the future of social networking via mobile devices.   
We indulged in small talk. We edged our way closer to the topic at hand and then, when we found a gap we liked, we gave our pitch. We presented our business plan (which he put aside and didn’t look at). We pitched ourselves as hard as we could to the man who might just hold our future in his pockets.   
The meeting ended and we did not, shockingly, walk away with a handshake deal for millions of dollars. That’s how it happens in the movies. That is not how it happens in life.   
We officially submitted our funding proposal on the 12th of January, 2010 to 4Di. 4Di is the Cape Town based venture capital fund that Justin founded. It’s a small team of people even now but at the time it was Justin and two friends of his, Anton and Doug, as well as Erik, the older and apparently more grown up of us all. We would eventually secure funding from 4Di in April 2010\. Those three and a half months felt like an eternity. The days dragged on as we hung around at Vodacom trying to balance our excitement for the new venture with the daily tasks of our corporate jobs. It took a full three months of continued building and development of our core product, tweaking of the prototype and engagement with Justin and the 4Di team before we received the following email from Anton at 4Di on the 21st of April:  
   
*Hi Guys*  
   
*We are very happy to formally inform you that our seed committee has approved the Motribe investment.*  
   
*The next step will be the negotiation of a term sheet and milestones. We can start this process immediately and hope to work with you guys closely in order to get it done as soon as possible. We will follow with an email outlining the process leading to conclusion of the term sheet and flow of funds.*  
   
*Congratulations guys\!*  
   
*Kind Regards*  
*Anton*

On the 17th of May in 2010 Vincent and I signed the term sheet and agreed to move to Cape Town to build Motribe. This was a massive milestone, but it was not without complication.

## **RELOCATING MY LIFE**

My partner Jen and I both lived in Johannesburg and we had just managed to overcome a break-up, get back together and find a happy place. She had a great job and loved living in Joburg. I had just bought a house and had never lived in Cape Town. I had no support system there, no friends, no family and no reason to be in Cape Town other than the insistence of my new investors. Vincent had a wife and a kid and had to uproot everything and give up a great corporate job to start a company that statistically was destined to fail.   
This is insanity but this is what I was living for; a chance to finally build something big and meaningful with funding and a niche that was about to explode. We had finally made it. I wish that the story of raising funding for Motribe was more sordid, complex and interesting than it actually was, but we genuinely did not struggle to raise money because we had an actual product with actual users in a real niche within our area of expertise.   
The next few months were a big blur. Jen agreed that moving to Cape Town and building Motribe was an opportunity that I couldn’t turn down. We decided to stay together and do long distance again. She gave me space to build Motribe, move to Cape Town and selfishly focus on myself and my ambitions. I didn’t sell my house but instead rented it out to my father. I packed up my shit, put most of it in my car and then shipped my car down to Cape Town. Vincent and I both resigned from Vodacom to the surprise of our boss Jose. Jose was a fantastic boss who understood our desire to build something of our own but he was a lifetime corporate employee and careered Telco loyalist so I’m not sure if he really got it or just knew that neither of us were cut out to build corporate careers at big businesses that battled with innovation.   
The last day of July in 2010 was my last day in Johannesburg. To be honest I don’t remember anything from that day. I don’t remember saying goodbye to Jen, to my parents or leaving my house. I don’t remember driving my car to the train station, I don’t remember how I got to the airport or the flight to Cape Town. I don’t remember any of it because I don’t think I could bring myself to think about it while it was happening. I was trying to cope with the uncertainty that I was bringing upon myself. I was leaving my city of birth, my friends, my partner, my parents, my house, my job and everything I knew to venture into the unknown. I do not remember being afraid. I remember being excited and aware of something very important happening. I knew this move was going to change things for me but I just didn’t know exactly how.   
I landed in Cape Town and Vincent and I were picked up by his wife D from the Cape Town International Airport. It was a warm day with no rain and no wind. I piled into the back of their car next to their son who was in a car seat next to me. Our very first task was to collect my car from the storage facility. What should have been a quick 40-minute drive from the airport to the storage facility turned into a two-hour escapade. D was driving and refused to ask for directions because she insisted that she knew where she was. I had no fucking clue where I was or where we were going. It was a weekend so no one was working and there was no one to call at the storage place. We basically drove up and down the roads of Stellenbosch until D found a road that looked familiar. We would then turn down that road and hope that she saw another road that looked familiar. Not how I expected Day 1 of my new life in Cape Town to pan out. Eventually we found my car. I got into a haven of familiarity, turned on the aircon, put on some familiar music and started to drive to my new home.   
Moving cities is not an easy task. Moving cities alone is even harder and puts an immense strain on your mental stability. I’ve always been proud of my ability to do things alone, but moving to Cape Town to build Motribe was one of the most difficult things I’ve done alone.

## **CELEBRATE THE RIGHT THINGS**

There are a lot of things to celebrate when you start a business. There’s the first office, the first clients, the fund-raise, the first hire, the first big deal, your exit and literally anything else you can think of that you might want to celebrate. It’s easy to get caught up celebrating everything and invariably you’ll end up celebrating the wrong things.   
‘What are the wrong things?’ I can hear you asking yourself. In my opinion it’s anything that promotes the vanity of your business or the founders. If you are celebrating your new user registration milestone, if you’re celebrating a round of funding, if you’re celebrating how much turnover you did last year then you’re probably celebrating the wrong things. How can I say so with such certainty? Because I have celebrated all of the wrong things in the past. At Motribe we managed to celebrate and monitor the wrong things at just about every turn. We announced and promoted our fund-raise. We celebrated user numbers while ignoring churn rate (how many users were leaving once they had registered). We did it all wrong. Take it from me, the things you want to focus on are not the shiny, pretty, fluffy things. It’s the numbers that prove your business model and illustrate it is a sustainable one that you want to celebrate. Things like profit, lifetime value of a customer and user retention are worth celebrating if they’re going in the right direction.

When I moved to Cape Town I lived with Jess, a friend of Jen’s, for a few months, until Motribe could find offices that would also double up as my apartment. Because we hadn’t found offices, we were working out of our investor’s offices. Life was disruptive to say the least. I had no home of my own, no friends, no partner near me and no offices to make my own. Jess lived in Observatory in Cape Town and Vincent had found a place out in Milnerton. It’s about a 30-minute drive from Observatory to Milnerton. The 4Di offices were a short five-minute drive from where I was in Observatory so I was at least happy about the short commute to work, except when I was driving out to Milnerton at 3am to work at V’s place.   
V has always liked to work late. From the days of StudentWire I began to understand his pattern of sleep and work. He was inspired to work when everyone else is sleeping. That makes for interesting hours when you are building a startup. We would do planning in the office between 9am and 5pm and then he would go home, hang out with his family and start writing code. I had nothing else to do, so I would drive to his house after dinner and sit and work there deep into the next morning. I’d drive home sometimes at 3am, sleep and the repeat this for weeks on end. Building a tech company is pretty frustrating for the non-technical co-founder in the beginning. There’s very little to be done until the platform is built and the technology is working. I played the role of moral support, launch planning, marketing, investor relationship and anything else I could do.   
V and I worked like men possessed to get Motribe live. In six weeks we had built the first iteration of the platform. We launched our website and product on 13th September 2010\.

When we launched publicly we thought it would be seen as an epic accomplishment. It should have received nationwide coverage in all the media outlets. We should have immediately had thousands of users sign up and pay us. At least that’s what we thought. Holy shit, were we wrong. I chuckle every time I think back to how naive I was about that first day. We were well connected in the media world, having both worked in large media companies. We put together the perfect PR promo and fired it off to every journalist and media organisation locally and globally that we could think of, knew or could scrape an email for. I spent days and days talking to journalists over email trying to convince them that we had just accomplished something amazing. Not surprisingly, we had very few bites and our launch was only covered in a handful of online publications.   
No matter how strong your founding team is, no matter how good your product might be and how much money you’ve raised, once you are live the only thing that matters is staggering traction. Without staggering traction there is no real need to cover your business in the media. Even if you are solving an impossible problem with amazing tech, unless someone is using the tech to actually solve that problem then all you have is a theoretical fix, not a business.   
If you are about to launch something here’s some quick-fire advice: Launching a product is not a mark of success. Building something is not the pinnacle. Going live is only the start of the journey. In the game of business building, launching is the first level of thousands of levels that you need to clock. If you build it, they will not come. They will not talk about you. They will not find you. They will not know your name. It’s your job to make them know who you are, what you do, sign up, pay and stick around. Launching is only the start. If you’re about to launch and think the hard work is done, let me be the one to burst your tiny startup bubble: you have 99 per cent of the way still to go, so get your product launched and then start the grind. 

Launching did help us to achieve two pretty significant things very early in our journey. I managed to sign our first platform customer before we even went live with the final product. Secondly, once we had gone live, we signed Guinness to our platform to build them a social network in Nigeria. 

These two clients helped us bring in close to R5 000 000 in revenue in our first ten months of operation. We were on fire. Everything we touched worked. Every meeting we had went well. Every interview we did helped to create a hype cycle that drove more users and business our way. Our egos were growing as quickly as our bank balance. Our lack of experience was preventing us from taking time to process, build, iterate and improve our tech. We had created the best kind of funding within the first few weeks of opening our doors to the world: profit.   
This, however, was not good enough for us because we were caught in the fund-raising \> growth \> fund-raising \> growth cycle. We were stuck in the habit of seeking out the wrong kind of affirmation. Early sales from your core revenue model and real, genuine user traction and retention are things to celebrate. We were not celebrating those things. We were celebrating all of the things that made us look good and feel big. Things like how many users we could acquire, how much top line revenue (not profit) we were making from sources that weren’t really proving our model and how many staff we could hire.   
This surprising injection of cash meant that we could afford to bring forward our plans to hire staff. Vincent needed help coding the core Motribe platform and I needed his help growing our client list and strategy for the business. If we hired someone to code it would free up his time to work with me and grow our revenue, pitch agencies and clients and attract users to the platform. Originally we had only planned to hire someone after 12 months but all of our plans were moved forward dramatically once we had clients paying us real money. 

## **21**

## **THE SECOND (FAILED) FUND-RAISE**

Around the same time that we were starting to think about hiring someone, we were also planning a trip to the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. Why? Because we could afford to after landing a few clients and getting more money in the bank. Our traction was so significant (in our view) that we believed we could start hunting for further funding to grow even more. This is the way of the VC backed tech company: exponential growth or death. We were aiming for the former.   
It didn’t help our egos that we were being approached by VC firms from all over the world shortly after we launched and announced our traction (PR kings). Firms in New York, Boston and London had all reached out to me, struck up relationships and were fishing for information. I struggled to bat them away as I should have. Instead I became quite swept up with the idea that we could raise a massive round of funding in dollars and really start to expand our mobile social network builder into developing markets across the globe. All we needed to do was meet with these investors face to face and we’d be golden. I began to meet with these firms over Skype and build relationships with the point people who were looking after the African markets and mobile technology. I was stunned at how far ahead of the market Motribe was, how much knowledge we had regarding mobile and how well our platform was performing. Every VC we spoke with showed interest and was impressed.   
Except for one.   
One of the firms that I managed to get a meeting with was Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know this firm, that’s OK. They have backed massive businesses like Airbnb, Apple, Cisco, Dropbox, Google, Instagram, PayPal and many, many, many others. Sequoia is the holy grail of VC firms. Roelof Botha is one of the partners at Sequoia. He’s a South African expat who made a name for himself working with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel at PayPal. I don’t know Roelof and I had no direct way of getting in touch with him. But at the time I absolutely had to show Sequoia what we were doing so I composed an email to him and titled it: Cape Town Startup Taking Over Africa. I played to his roots in the Cape and started to guess at his email address. I sent emails to roelof.botha@sequioa.com, r.botha@sequioa.com, botharoelof@sequioa.com and every other variation I could think of.   
It worked.   
Within a week I had been contacted by Tim, the head of mobile and Africa investments at Sequoia Capital. We set up a Skype call and pitched Motribe. We did our best but were completely overwhelmed by the obvious, simple and straightforward questions that the Sequoia team asked: 

* How many users do you have?   
* How many of them are paying?   
* What’s your cost per acquisition?   
* What’s the lifetime value of a customer? 

We had a follow-up call to try to answer these questions but we were punching above our weight. We received a very polite email a few weeks later that we should continue to build our platform, grow traction and improve revenues and then get back in touch with Tim. That was the response of a professional firm that knew their business and ours better than we did. They hit the nail on the head. Did I listen? No. Did I hear what they were trying to say? No. Did I continue to try to raise more money? Hell, yes.   
Over the next 12 months I would fly to New York and London to meet with venture capital firms, investment brokers, acquaintances who were helping me connect and network and potential partners. For every trip I made I would have another 50 Skype calls with potential investors. My focus became more funding. I met with firms like Bessemer Ventures (a 100-year-old investment firm), Atomica, Solidea, Premanco, Gray Ghost, Insight Partners, Omidyar, Imprint Capital and others. I learned some incredible lessons pitching to so many investment companies and smart people. I failed dismally and did not manage to raise money from any of them. I knocked on hundreds of doors, sent hundreds of emails and met with many, many, many people. Not a single one gave me money after trying to raise money for 12 months. I learned a lot going out and fund-raising and I’ve distilled these lessons into these bullet points:

* No one knows your business better than you do (except for Sequoia).   
* A ‘maybe’ is a polite ‘no’. Learn to spot the rejection and move on quickly. Don’t waste your time chasing the ‘maybe’.   
* ‘We’ll invest, if you find a lead investor’ means ‘no thank you’.  
* When a global firm asks you to move your HQ to their city, they don’t want to invest in you, that’s another way to say ‘no’.  
* Raising money before you are ready is a death kiss for your business.   
* Raising money requires 75 per cent of your time. It’s not a part-time job. At least one founder needs to fund-raise almost full time.   
* Great businesses attract great investors.

That last point is the important one for most businesses. You know which businesses raise the best kind of money? Profitable ones.   
At the end of it all, it was our investors who managed to help us through the business in the most sane way possible. Raising money is a double-edged sword. If I had more control in the business in terms of equity ownership and voting rights then I would have been able to outvote and win every decision at a board level. However, when you have a board, investors and a co-founder with equity, you don’t get to make the decisions on your own. If you are obsessed with maintaining ownership and control then it’s best not to raise funding of any kind. Yes, of course there are examples of founders who have sold equity but retained control and the most obvious that jumps to mind is Mark Zuckerberg. The Zuck, with the help of his early investor and mentor Peter Thiel, was able to sell of chunks of Facebook but always retain the voting rights of the incoming investors. That’s an incredibly rare achievement. To own a minority share of your company but still be able to outvote any decision on your own is a rarity and not the standard. If you think you’re the outlier here let me fill you in ... you are not. Nor was I. With investors came dilution and destruction of my ownership and control.

## **HIRING A TEAM AT A STARTUP**

It’s easy to be in a rush when you are building a startup. Everything is about growth, expansion, big numbers, amazing offices and huge teams. This is a trap. Growth for the sake of growing is a trap. Who has the biggest turnover is a trap. Having a massive team is an ego trap. It’s all a trap. The only thing that is not a trap is profit. Raising funding is a trap if you’re raising it for the sake of a press release and more staff.   
Prior to starting Motribe, every business I had founded and run was a startup in the truest sense: a couple of founders grinding it out every day until something worked and we could eke out a bit of money from a client. When we raised money at Motribe we were teed up to grow. We weren’t sure why we were growing or what we were running from or chasing but we had to fucking grow ... because ... growth, obviously.   
Hiring a team is not something that should be taken lightly. I believe that too many founders believe that it’s their right to hire amazing team members. I believe it’s a privilege and the people I hire also feel that it’s a privilege to work with me and my company. Reed Hastings, the CEO at Netflix is very specific about growing the culture at Netflix. He doesn’t call his staff a family, his staff have families at home. He believes that the people who work at Netflix should be thought of as a high performing team filled with A players, the best of the best. I prefer this analogy to any other I’ve come across. Hiring should be a carefully thought out process with steps to ensure a culture fit above all else. I’ve hired people for skill, for attitude, for the promise they held and for many other reasons. It’s the staff that I’ve hired based on cultural fit that have always lasted the longest and done the best work.   
I would also like to urge startup founders out there to think very carefully about the growth trajectory you might be on. If your organisation is five people strong and you’re overthinking culture, job satisfaction, office decor and other pretty irrelevant things then you should probably slow down, engage with your team one on one or five on one and enjoy the ride. You can’t fake or force culture – it trickles down from the top and then grows back up from the bottom.   
The major lessons that I’ve learned over time are to hire slowly and fire quickly. When you find the gifted talent you’ve been searching for, make sure you put them through the full hiring process before offering them a job. If they turn out to be horrible humans you do not have to keep them around because of their talent; fire them and move on. Culture will prevail. 

It’s now less than 6 months after the launch of the Motribe platform and we have clients operating on the platform and steady revenue and growth. Vincent and I decide to hire our first team member, Sean. We believed that we needed someone to take on the basic platform management day to day so that the two of us could focus on growth and managing the clients. In truth, I believed that we needed Sean because the founders needed to go out and fund-raise. Sean would pick up a large portion of V’s work and then Vincent and I would be able to travel and raise funding, get new business and go on trips to meet customers. Sean was meant to be there to hold down the fort. He joined us in February of 2011 and we left for a month long trip in March.   
Take it from me, you cannot onboard and then abandon a new team member in four weeks. You think you can but you can’t. You think you’re different but you’re not. We left Sean alone in the office for the next four weeks and, surprisingly, he managed well enoughl. Vincent and I did not, but more on that a bit further on in the story.  
At Motribe I learned some tough lessons about hiring, firing, building a culture and understanding interpersonal dynamics. I did not learn these lessons easily. They came to me slowly and painfully. I did a lot of learning after the fact but these lessons would prove to be invaluable when I moved on and into my next businesses. 

### 

### ***Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly*** 

South African employment laws make it quite difficult for employers to remove staff who don’t work out in a particular position and need to move. This means that in South Africa we can’t have a business of quickly rotating staff to find a culture that works. You need to be more calculated about who you hire, how you hire, how you engage with your staff throughout their employment and how you eventually choose to fire people.   
I was so nervous about making a mistake when it came to Motribe’s HR policy that I hired a professional South African HR consultant to put together a simple to read employment contract that reflected our culture. I wanted ours to be a culture of freedom and responsibility. I’ve always tried really hard to allow my team to be the best at their jobs and do the job in their own way. I give people enough freedom to wreak havoc if they really want to. Our contracts needed to reflect this. I tried hard to get rid of any jargon or legalese in the contracts so that they could be understood by someone who did not have a degree in law or human resources. An example of the type of quirk in our team culture that I decided to implement was something I called ‘Bolt-On Leave’. We had the standard allocated annual leave that our team could make use of. If they used this up in a 12-month cycle but still managed to work their asses off, perform brilliantly and tick certain boxes, they could apply for seven days of extra, bolt-on leave that was added to their annual leave allocation at our discretion (hence ‘bolt-on’ because it’s added at the end).   
Hiring slowly is also a difficult thing to do when you believe you are in a high growth and highly competitive space. At Motribe we believed that our competitors were coming to eat our lunch and we needed to get a jump on them. That meant hiring, growing, raising money and doing all the right things in the wrong order and at the wrong speed.   
We did not hire slowly. We interviewed a few people and hired the one that ‘felt the best’. Over time Vincent and I developed some form of hiring process but it was nowhere near stringent enough to sift the good from the great. We found ourselves with developers who were able to pass our short coding test but couldn’t stack up in a real work environment. Romano lasted two months before I helped him to find a path out of Motribe’s door. We had a guy who we hired because he was such a great developer. We quickly discovered that culturally he was a terrible fit for us. He didn’t like to talk or engage with the team, he didn’t really like to do work that he didn’t like and he had an aggressive streak that made people in the office uncomfortable. I refused his resignation once because we were slammed, but two short weeks later I asked for his resignation back and let him leave.   
Rob Stokes started and ran one of South Africa’s most successful advertising agencies called Quirk. Quirk is still around today but Rob doesn’t run it any more. When he did, he was pedantic about hiring his team, even when the company grew into the hundreds of people. The hiring process at Quirk happened in six rounds. First they review your CV and either accept or refuse you at this point. Second, you are given your first interview with their hiring manager. Then you have your next interview with your future teammates, a panel of four people. You then have a ‘Christmas Party’ interview – if they sat next to you at the Christmas party, having never met you, would you all get on? This is the interview with future colleagues who will not be in your immediate team and is a test for cultural fit. This stage requires at least five people and if two people give you a ‘no’ vote then the process of hiring you is stopped immediately. If you make it through these phases you then meet with the MD or CEO. Every single person that Quirk hired went through this process while Rob was at Quirk (I can’t speak for the business right now). Quirk was almost doubling their business every year between 2009 and 2013 and you could argue that keeping such close guard of their culture was the key to this growth. Many great candidates with amazing CVs often did not make it through, but that was the entire point of the process; sometimes the skills written down on a CV don’t relate into a company culture.  
That’s a fairly intense interview process. Our process was not like this in spite of our believing that it was. We had a few rounds of interviews too. You’d sit with Vincent and me for a short interview where we asked the same questions to basically every employee. You know the ones; ‘Where do you see yourself in blah blah blah?’ ‘What is your favourite thing about your last job?’ ‘What did you like the least about your last boss?’ ‘How long have you blah blah blah?’ It was boring. I was bored in those interviews but we were hiring because we needed to hire people to look like we were a big business – so we hired people. Hiring people is cool, right? Right? RIGHT?  
It’s not cool to hire people for the sake of it. It’s not cool to have 100 people working for you when you only need 20\. It’s not cool to refer to people as ‘heads’ and say your ‘headcount is over 200 now’. That’s not cool. That’s sad. These are people in your organisation and you should think of them as such. I always did. I love working with people but, man, did we struggle to hire the right kinds of people for our business. It’s not easy and it never gets easier. That’s why your rule has to be to hire slowly and fire quickly.   
Find the great people and keep them. Find the shitty people and lose them, fast.

### ***Get Rid Of The Poison***

Our first hire, Sean, became our first fire too. Technically I didn’t actually have to fire him because he ultimately resigned. This is one of the ways that South African businesses work through the strenuous employment laws to get rid of difficult or underperforming team members; we help them to find a way out of the business that they choose on their own through a resignation. Sean was the kind of employee who wanted a big and stable salary coupled with a few share options and then he wanted to live the life and slowly build something. Unfortunately we were in rapid-iteration mode and did not need employees who wanted to coast along. I needed focus, drive and attention. Sean provided us with none of those things.   
When he eventually resigned we allowed him to work out his resignation period of one month. This was the first and last time that I would allow any employee of mine to work through their resignation period. Vincent and I would leave the office for meetings and return to a sullen, quiet and sombre office environment. The team would arrive at work happy, spend time without the founders, and leave ready to jump out of our second-storey windows. It was a confusing time for me because I just couldn’t figure out what was happening. At no point did I consider that Sean was poisoning the team with extreme negativity.   
The moment that I stepped out of the office he would begin talking about how badly the business was doing, how badly we were managing the company, that we were taking the business in the wrong direction and how unhappy our investors were with our progress. Anything that he could say to justify his choice to leave was fair game. The minute that I walked back into the office he would stop and no one would say anything. When he eventually left the mood of the office immediately changed and went back to what we had expected it to be. That’s when the penny dropped and I sat down with another one of our employees and asked her what the fuck had gone on. She eventually told me that Sean would sit at his desk, do no work and shout his mouth off about everything and anything that he could think of. If you are leaving a company you should be considerate towards the people who are staying and try not to bad mouth their place of employment and choices. If they ask you to discuss your reasons for leaving then do it in private and have a bit of respect for yourself and your decisions.   
That was the last time I let anyone stay in my company when they’d chosen to leave. From that moment on, when you resign or are fired I do my best to allow you to leave the company immediately with pay for the time you are owed. This doesn’t always work out because sometimes people can be dicks. But since 2011 I’ve had only one team member that we needed to stay to work shifts in our retail stores. Everyone else leaves when I want them to leave. 

### ***Rip The Band-Aid Off***

I’ve experienced my fair share of bosses and have yet to meet a single person who feels comfortable firing people from their team. I have done this enough in my career to have learned a few simple things. Here’s some advice for the next time you have to fire or retrench someone: 

1. *Do it quickly*. Dragging out the process is only going to make it worse for both parties. You will feel the need to fill the awkward silence before the exact moment of truth with idle small talk and then it becomes increasingly more difficult to break the news. Sit down and start talking about the situation at hand.   
2. *Be honest*. Don’t make up some fake story about the reason for them needing to leave. Give them the real reasons because more often than not those are the most defensible reasons. If the person chooses to take you to court over the action then at least you won’t have to lie about anything.   
3. *Be direct*. Dancing around the issue at hand leaves a lot of room for misunderstanding. That’s the last thing you want when you are having difficult conversations. Be direct and show the person the respect you would want when being removed from a business.   
4. *Don’t talk too much*. Try to say what needs to be said using as few words as possible. The more you talk, the more difficult the situation becomes. Don’t be cold and removed, just be simple, straightforward and open.   
5. *Listen.* Very often the person you are dealing with will be expecting the conversation and action that follows so they’ll have questions. It’s important to be prepared with answers but be a proactive listener and hear them out. Don’t interrupt them, be calm and let them vent. If they didn’t expect it, things will get emotional and difficult. This is when it is most important to listen.   
6. *Document everything*. Throughout your team’s employment it is imperative to record every formal engagement with them around discipline and rewards. In the eyes of South African law you will need to be able to illustrate that you did the best you could do at all times to give the person every opportunity to succeed, fit in and do their work. The more you document the better position you will find yourself in.

## **THE FAT AND UNHEALTHY FOUNDER**

Here’s an instruction that I wish I took more seriously more often in my life: treat yourself better. Exercise, eat well, sleep well and much of your anxiety will dissipate and leave you almost entirely. I wish that it was more complicated than this but it just isn’t.   
Making your health and fitness your number one priority seems counter-intuitive but it’s not. The times in my life when I have been most effective and efficient is when I’ve been on a strict and consistent routine of eating, sleeping and training. These things in combination make me a happier and more productive person. When I sleep well, I’m a new person in the morning. When I train, same thing. If I’m eating well, I’m a ball of energy. If you combine these things consistently (more than a month repetitively) then, trust me, you will be happier and succeed more often. It’s an ironic misunderstanding that most entrepreneurs will put their own health at the bottom of their priority list instead of the top. We should all be looking after ourselves first and then the rest falls into place. Not the other way around.   
Every business book I’ve ever read, every successful entrepreneur I’ve ever spoken with directly or listened to on a podcast will tell you the same thing: healthier people are happier and more productive people. I know, I know, you want to tell me that you’re different. You want to tell me that you can ‘hustle’ harder than anyone else for the two hours that you could be exercising. You can be the one who proves everyone else wrong. I’ve got news for you: you can’t. I thought I was that person too. I’m not. Everything in my life suffers when I am unhealthy and unhappy.   
For me, the penny always drops when my pants start to feel a bit tight and my T-shirts start to hug my stomach a bit more tightly than they used to. I am incredibly self-conscious about my body. When I gain weight I can feel it and when I feel it I think about it. When I’m thinking about my weight I stress eat. When I stress eat I gain more weight and then when I gain more weight I stress about my weight more and think about my work less. This is a vicious cycle that defeats me in vicious cycles. As I write this, I am getting into a new routine of eating, sleeping and training. It’s tough but necessary.   
Without fail, whenever I am severely sick I know that I am overstressed about business and working too hard. Yes, there is such a thing as working too hard. There’s a pretty famous entrepreneur called Gary Vaynerchuk. I respect Gary immensely because he’s managed to achieve a lot in his career as an entrepreneur. He built a massive online wine business and now runs a big advertising agency. He has also written a few *New York Times* best-sellers and is famous for preaching the hustle. Gary believes that if you want something all you need to do is hustle your face off to get it. Work days, nights, weekends, sleep less and be driven. Fuck what Gary Vaynerchuk says, you can hustle yourself to death and you just don’t have to. My stress manifests itself in extreme physical ways. This methodology may work for Gary, but it sure as shit doesn’t work for me.   
While building Motribe I had kidney stones ... twice. I used to get migraines (that I would work through in all my grumpiness) and at one point in building Motribe I even had a stomach ulcer that required hospitalisation.  
It was a few months into Motribe and for a few weeks I had struggled with my stomach. Every time I ate something I would get an immediate stomach ache. I fobbed it off because I was busy. I would sit through the pain, becoming more frustrated and irritable. Things at work continued to deteriorate and I continued to deteriorate at the same pace. I would sit up late at night with heavy anxiety considering the options that I had in front of me: raise more money, take a pay cut, fire someone, sell harder, tweak the website, talk to my co-founder, discuss the business with my board, investors, friends. Then while lying in bed with these issues running through my mind, my stomach would flare up again and I would find myself sitting on the toilet doubled over and moaning in pain hour after hour. Of course, this meant that I was not sleeping properly at all. I went months without a good night’s sleep. At no point did I put together the following variables: 

* I was not doing any physical exercise.   
* I was working 18 hours a day.   
* I was not eating properly.   
* I was not sleeping properly.   
* I was not talking to anyone about my struggles.   
* I had no support system with me in Cape Town at the start of Motribe. 

That last one is much more important than I ever believed. Jen was in Johannesburg for the beginning part of building Motribe and that meant that in an emergency I was pretty much on my own. That’s precisely what happened. One night I realised that I wasn’t going to make it through the night without going to the hospital. The pain was excruciating. Forget about sleep, I could barely stop myself from screaming bloody murder and making my neighbours think I was being butchered. I lay in bed in the foetal position rocking myself while trying to come up with a plan for getting myself to the hospital in my current state. There was no Uber back then so I did what any sane entrepreneur would do. I got in my car, in my pyjamas, and drove myself to the hospital. I don’t want to make this sound dramatic – I lived about 200 metres away from the hospital so the drive was short. Regardless, it was a stupid move. I got into the emergency room and was given pethidine for the pain. I have never felt such elation in my life. The relief (mental and physical) was absolutely overwhelming as I passed out.    
I called Jen when I woke up the next day and she insisted on flying down before the doctors decided to cut me open to figure out what the hell was going on. Fortunately for me she arrived in time and decided to take me to a general practitioner before the surgeons sliced and diced me. It turns out that I had a severe and prolonged allergic reaction to one of the pills I was taking to keep me awake and stave off flu. This pill had caused a massive stomach ulcer that had made me so sick. I pushed through and almost needed surgery to save myself from myself.   
A permanent by-product of my stress manifesting itself physically is the constant and never-ending heartburn that I now have. Over many years of stressing myself out I have forced my body to produce excessive stomach acid. It is as uncomfortable as it sounds and it’s not a pleasant thing to live with. I am telling you this because I’m sick of reading articles and books about ‘How to be a millionaire’ that don’t mention the side effects of the success. I am permanently on medication because of this stomach acid issue. Forever. That’s what building a business has gotten me. I’m not making millions of dollars for myself but I am sure as shit making some pharmaceutical company stinking rich every year.   
A funny and strange physical quirk that popped up at Motribe was an excessive amount of peeing. I’m not talking about drinking a lot of water and then peeing. I had worked myself into such a frenzy that all of a sudden I realised I was peeing every hour, sometimes twice an hour throughout the day and night. Think about that carefully: you sit down to write an email and have to stop yourself to go and pee. You get back, you start working on a proposal and you have to stop yourself to go and pee. You go into an hour-long pitch session and you have to excuse yourself midway so you can go and pee. It was becoming embarrassing. It was a running joke in the Motribe offices that people knew the time by my pee schedule every hour on the hour. I eventually went to see a urologist when I realised what was happening. I wasn’t sleeping because I was peeing three to four times a night which led to me being tired and more stressed all the time. His unfortunate answer to my problem was that I was making myself pee. It was a mental issue that I had created and manifested into constant peeing. His advice? Hold it in. I had to retrain myself to pee like a normal person.   
This is an extremely odd and overly intimate story but one that illustrates the things entrepreneurs won’t normally tell you about. I’m here to tell you that I peed a lot when I was building Motribe. I had stomach ulcers, kidney stones, migraines, insomnia, constant flu and insane levels of stress that caused almost all of my issues. I was not taking care of myself in the name of building my business and it really messed me up.   
I completely understand that there are periods when entrepreneurs have to work long hours and hustle harder than normal but the trap I fell into was that this became my normal. It’s not normal. Insanely hard hustle is not sustainable. It’s not something to brag about. Working long hours, sleeping badly, eating worse and not training are all bad things, not good things. The seasoned entrepreneurs that I know will tell you that they started to come into their own when they began to manage their time and prioritise themselves and their health.

## **TAKE A PAY CUT**

   
What would you do for profit in your business? Would you change your business model? Would you do work that isn’t part of your mandated scope of work? Would you cut expenses? Would you work in your startup for free? Would you move to a smaller office? Would you fire staff cut back on nice coffee? What’s your limit?   
Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, is one of my favourite entrepreneurs and business writers. Jason wrote an article titled ‘Outlasting’ and something he said in this article really stuck with me: ‘You don’t lose money by making it, you lose it by spending too much of it\! Duh\! I know\!’ This hit me hard and really embedded itself in my brain. Often we are told as startup founders to grow, make more money, increase turnover and everything will be OK. But often there isn’t time to grow that topline. Often it’s easier and faster to cut. Cutting expenses is a great way to make sure that you give yourself the best chance of survival. Growing revenue depends very much on things you can’t control; will your customers buy your product, how many will they buy, will your suppliers come to the party and give you a good price, can your clients pay on time, etc, etc, etc. Cutting expenses is a harder but much simpler route to go. It’s hard because you’re cutting up this thing you’ve worked so hard to construct. It’s simpler because you are in control.   
At Motribe we were bleeding cash. It wasn’t a paper cut kind of bleed, it was more of an aorta kind of bleed straight from the heart of the business and gushing from the neck. We were losing money quicker than we were making it. I took a salary cut month after month to make sure I could pay my staff and keep the business afloat. Vincent never did. We discussed it but he refused time after time because he had a family to support and he believed he deserved the salary.   
So I did what the CEO should do. That was an alarm bell that should have rung much louder in my brain than it did, if I’m honest with myself. I sacrificed every luxury that I could to make it work. I ate into my savings month after month to keep the business going and show commitment to our investors. I went out hunting for clients, pitched everyone I could and hustled. Back then I hustled hard and hit the grind 16, 18, 20 hours a day. It was brutal, but I believed that this was the way to become profitable. The truth is, no amount of work can sell a broken product and that’s what we had at Motribe. We had a broken product that, years later, Vincent would admit he had no idea how to fix or make work. I was out selling this mangled product and pushing agency work, any work, while our core product just wasn’t good enough. The market was telling us as much by avoiding it like a technological plague.   
No one would stay on our platform long enough for us to make money out of them.   
All the information we needed was there in front of us. We were staring at the users leaving every day. We were staring at the cash flow taking a dive every week. We were staring at our staff struggling for solutions every month. I flat out refused to believe that I couldn’t grind my way out of this problem so I worked longer hours and harder days.   
Ironically, we actually did have a product that was working. Big companies wanted our platform to build their own campaign-based social networks. We had this product that earned us revenue and could keep the ship afloat but in our minds it was the wrong kind of money. We had an idea about what we were building and what we wanted it to be and we would not deviate from the plan. We were married to the idea and ignoring the flow of revenue and customer adoption.   
It’s difficult to come to terms with a shift in business model and many entrepreneurs are unable to manage it well or at all. It is frequently called a ‘pivot’ when a business takes on a new focus or revenue model. Imagine that you are selling pots and pans but after each customer you visit they ask you to deliver a package to the next customer. If you look at the information in front of you, you’re being told that there’s an opportunity to start a small delivery company. If you then do that, you’ve pivoted your business model away from pots and pans and towards delivering items. At Motribe we were being told by the market what was going to work but we did not listen. Our egos told us that we needed a consumer facing business that earned enough money to make us rich. But that was not happening and we were stuck in the mud.   
Cash flow problems bring many other problems and a huge one for Motribe was founder tension. The kind of constant tension that Vincent and I had because we couldn’t make things work was wreaking havoc on our partnership as well as our staff and customers. Our staff knew there was something going on. Our investors would sit in board meetings with us and openly berate my performance and my co-founder would agree with them or say nothing to defend me.   
As the CEO of the company all the failings sat with me. I would stay up every night worrying about the next month’s salaries, rent, hosting costs, advertising costs and every other cent that was due. I would work on our strategy and think of new ways to make money. I would do the finances and then redo them, but whichever way I hacked it we had less than three months of money in the bank before the business would go under. Three months isn’t that long if your model isn’t working and you’re making less money than you are spending. At the time, I thought I was doing OK, but looking back I was a fucking train wreck and so was our business.   
As I mentioned in a previous chapter, we signed two clients very soon after we launched. These two clients basically made our business real. However, they were not bringing us the kind of money we wanted to earn. On the Guinness account we were working with an agency called Praekelt which is run by Gustav. Gustav, Vincent and I had an existing relationship from our time at Vodacom. Gustav needed a platform to use in Nigeria to build a social network on mobile devices for Guinness. The platform was to be called GuinnessVIP. We had exactly what Gustav and Guinness needed and the deal was quickly concluded so we could get building.   
We did not set this deal up correctly from the start. This was a massive mistake and allowed for a lot of pain down the line. In principle, we were excited that a company as large as Guinness was using our platform but in practice we were dealing with an agency who was making more requests to change our platform than we could afford to attend to. We started to hold a very clear disdain for the people at Praekelt and my inexperience led me to bitch and moan about them instead of addressing the issues head on and solving the administrative problems.   
Internally, we began to mock and berate the Praekelt team. I acted extremely unprofessionally and over time my team began to hate working on the GuinnessVIP platform. They were bringing in millions in revenue each year and we despised the work. Again, we were ignoring the signs right in front of us that we had a working model. Instead of listening and manoeuvring ourselves to cater for this type of client we made a strategic decision never to work with customers like Guinness or Praekelt again. We made this decision while at the same time we had hired staff to work on the account and grow the platform with Guinness. We were not thinking clearly or sensibly about how we were structuring our company. Never, ever, ever grow your team off the back of a single client with no other prospects in the pipeline. As soon as the customer decides they’ve had enough of you, you’re out.   
That’s exactly what happened with Praekelt and Guinness. After 18 months with us Praekelt had built a similar platform and no longer needed us and our bullshit attitudes. They did not renew our contract and within a period of a week we lost almost two million rand in revenue and were up shit creek. Very quickly after that we lost another client and now we were severely overstaffed and underfunded.   
I did what any young, naive founder/CEO would do. I took it personally, hunkered down and believed that I could grow the business in a couple of months to save everyone’s jobs and our business. What I should have done was retrench staff and reduce our team, office space and development scope to increase our survival runway. I did not do this. I believed that it was best to push on, keep paying a large founder salary and massive salaries to staff that we no longer needed. We had recently hired a new CTO to take on Vincent’s work because he had lost interest in the platform and business and was focusing his time elsewhere in the business. Now we were paying big salaries to 14 people and we had just about no money coming in. Cash flow was fucked and so was I.   
We started to work with Mxit \- the biggest social network in South Africa at the time \- as our core platform was failing. We also did agency work to try to bridge financial gaps. We built tech and platforms for small retainers but the business wasn’t making moves towards a 10x return for our investors and Vincent was not engaged or happy doing grind work. Mxit work was a potential out for us but I was too naive to see that my partner was unhappy, investors were doubtful and we needed just such an out.   
Vincent saw the out but did not build a parachute for me while he saw our plane on fire. He went behind my back and executed a coup that ended my business. If we had managed to keep cash rolling into the business and profits up then defending the business would have been easier for me but ultimately I didn’t have a long enough runway or the support I needed to turn the business around in the required time. I was out of options and I didn’t even know it.

## **PICK YOUR PARTNERS CAREFULLY**

If you have been paying attention to my stories Thus Far (see what I did there?) you will have noticed that Vincent and I worked together for a fairly long time before we started a business together. We had established certain roles and power dynamics before we raised any money or wrote any code. Vincent had been my boss and/or mentor throughout my career. He generally controlled the balance of power. Unfortunately, I believed that entering into a 50/50 partnership would rebalance the power in our relationship. It’s unfortunate because I was the only one who saw it this way. Choosing a business partner can be the simplest and most complicated thing you can do at your startup. Simple because your co-founders are often people you already know and find it easy to work with. Complicated because of the relationship dynamics that exist when you get into business together and try to find your new roles in the company.   
I have spoken to many startup founders over many years and without fail each of them has a co-founder story to tell. This chapter is my startup co-founder story.   
A few weeks after hiring Sean, Vincent and I left South Africa on a roadshow of sorts. We were gone for almost a month. We travelled to London to meet with potential clients and investors. We went to New York to have face to face meetings with VC firms who had asked us to meet with them so they could find out more. We then headed through to the SXSW conference in Austin which was our main reason for travelling. We believed that this conference was a fantastic place for young founders to launch their business.   
The naivety is embarrassing when I look back on it. We weren’t there to launch anything, we were there on a holiday. We attended the conference, listened to the founder of Tom’s Shoes speak, engaged with other techies but mostly hung out with other South Africans attending the conference. Very little actual work was done, if I’m honest. Conferences are no place to launch a business unless you have a massive budget to literally take over the conference branding and force word of mouth about your new shiny widget thing that everyone has to try out. This worked for Twitter and other US tech companies that successfully launched and gained traction at SXSW.   
For me, the highlight of the trip was seeing the Foo Fighters play live to a small crowd of a thousand people. This should have told me a bit more about the value of this trip than I realised at the time.  
Being away from your friends, family and business for three full weeks in the midst of building something new is difficult. Jen was moving to Cape Town around this time so I was feeling pressure having left when she was planning her move, booking her tickets and looking for places for us to live. Travelling with your business partner can be complicated. Doing those two things at the same time is a recipe for explosion, and explode we did.   
Vincent and I had managed to avoid conflict for the first two weeks of the trip. We made it through London and New York but the fatigue, unhealthy food and alcohol eventually combined to land us in a pretty massive fight that would come to dictate the next two years of our relationship without me realising it. One night after a long day of conferencing and a dinner with too much alcohol we got back to the hotel and started discussing the future of Motribe, why we were raising funding, the direction of the product and, more importantly, our roles in the business.   
After dancing around the issue for a tense 20 minutes, Vincent eventually came out with the truth: he did not believe that I was fit to be the CEO of his company. At this point I was the CEO of a three-person business doing less than R10 million a year. Basically, the CEO of nothing. Vincent said that I was too young, naive, inexperienced and emotional to manage investors, clients, partners and staff. In short: I was not a capable co-founder. I retaliated by calling him old, outdated, cold and emotionless and unable to manage our tech stack sufficiently. The argument ended with us agreeing to stick to our positions as CEO and CTO respectively and to let things play out. I don’t think the argument ended as well as it should have. We both left feeling uncomfortable and unhappy with the outcome. I didn’t realise how much unhappiness and discomfort Vincent retained. 

For my entire career I have been plagued by the feeling that I was about to be found out as a fraud. That if someone scratched just a little bit at my experience, ability, words, actions or anything else they would see that I was a fraud. If they looked a little bit deeper they would see that I was wearing the emperor’s new clothes. Naked and stupid. This fight with Vincent was a classic example of a mentor, friend and partner knowing exactly how to expose a wound that they knew was there because of your relationship. I was already second guessing myself, feeling confused about the next steps and wondering how on earth I was going to pull this one off and this drunken fight only reinforced those feelings of inadequacy. 

I now realise that this fight was the beginning of the end for my relationship with Vinent. Years later a friend of mine would tell me about something that seemed pretty irrelevant at the time but would help me understand so much once Vincent and I had parted ways. Craig had noticed that whenever Vincent wrote his biography (at conferences, on Twitter or Instagram or wherever else) he would label himself as the ‘Founder of Motribe’. While my biography would always read ‘Co-Founder of Motribe’. As I said, this seems to be an irrelevant observation, but knowing this information now clarifies how Vincent saw our two roles. He was the person who built the business and I was his sidekick or employee, not his co-founder. He was always my co-founder. I can be a dick a lot of the time but I am pretty good at giving credit where it is due and I could never have started Motribe without Vincent. I don’t think he feels the same way.   
Founder conflict is rot that few businesses can overcome. One of the key ways to overcome this massive problem at a startup is to communicate through it and compromise. I thought that Vincent and I had managed to successfully navigate our way through the founder conflict and hit our stride. As we hired more people to join our team we both hunkered down and focused on our roles more and more, but the anxiety only grew and the conflict intensified from one side.	  
While I was managing our team, hiring a new CTO to do Vincent’s Motribe work and trying to find clients to help us reach break even or profitability status, Vincent was out selling our business behind my back (and without the involvement of our investors). A year or so into Motribe we were approached by Alan Knott-Craig who had just bought Mxit and was interested in buying Motribe. He gave us a verbal offer of ±R60 million for our company and we scoffed at it. Whether that offer was sincere or not only Alan can say. We were ambitious entrepreneurs and weren’t willing to sell our vision for R60 million. As things would unfold that would turn out to be a pretty stupid decision on my part.   
Alan re-entered the picture about 18 months later as Motribe was struggling to perform on our core platform. Vincent had lost interest and focus on the core Motribe platform technology, we were churning users faster than we could afford to acquire them and Vincent was helpless to prevent the onslaught while I was out selling the platform as if it were a perfect working model of our vision. I had become the enemy and Vincent failed to communicate that to me or our board. Motribe and Mxit began working together more closely, we started to engage with the key playmakers at Mxit, including Alan himself, and experimented with apps built directly onto the Mxit platform. We had ideas, we knew how to market to a customer base and we had a team ready to execute. Mxit apps became Vincent’s focus and Motribe continued to be mine. We built an Instagram clone that registered over a million users in less than a month through the Mxit app portal. We were planning more and more integration with their platform and ours and things were beginning to look a little bit less stressful.   
In August of 2012 I had scheduled a Johannesburg trip to visit existing Motribe platform clients and go on a sales roadshow pitching to potential leads. I spent a week in Joburg and returned on Tuesday, 7th August. On the 8th I went in to work and met with Vincent at Seattle Coffee on Loop Street first thing in the morning as we had done hundreds of times before. I began to download my trip to Johannesburg telling him that we had just signed three new clients and had just reached a break even point in the business with these clients. Vincent stopped me. He looked down at his coffee and told me that he had sold Motribe to Alan at Mxit. He said that I should take Thursday to think about my options (9th August was a public holiday) and on Friday I should let him know if I was accepting the situation or going to make it difficult. I asked what would happen if I said no. Vincent responded by saying that he would leave the business and join Mxit while retaining his ownership of Motribe and I could continue to build without him, but he wouldn’t make it easy.   
I can’t believe that I didn’t see this coming. Looking back now makes me feel naive and stupid, but I just missed it. I should have seen it coming, but I didn’t. It’s insane that I hired a CTO to replace my CTO. It’s insane that Vincent worked on a side hustle with Mxit while I had nothing to do with it but paid him a full salary to do it and collude with Alan while I was taking pay cuts. It’s insane that he was able to talk to Alan about the sensitive information in our business without me. It’s ridiculous that I even let my relationship with him deteriorate to such an extent. It’s insane and my lack of experience and confidence at this point is shining through. I trusted my business partner, co-founder and ex-mentor to guide me through the pit of fury and instead I was walking a tightrope over this chasm of startup lava all alone. I cannot understate how lonely and brutal this period of my life was. Surrounded by a team of people, investors and a board while I was fighting for the life of my business all alone.  
I left the coffee shop in a state of shock and awe. Initially I thought that Vincent wasn’t serious. Then I realised that he was and it was time for me to pony up. Then I felt betrayed, lied to, misled and angry. I went home, told Jen what had happened and broke down and sobbed. I sobbed out of pure frustration that I had been so foolish and naive and had let people manipulate me the way Vincent and Alan had. I thought that we were all building the same vision but I was mistaken.   
It’s incredible how quickly your life and partnerships can go from working together on a common goal to sinking separately into quicksand. I was neck deep in quicksand and suffocating. With very little left in my corner to bargain with, I began to act out like caged dog. I met with Alan the very next day in an attempt to negotiate the price of the exit. Unfortunately for me, Vincent had already negotiated this and shared any and all sensitive company information with Alan so I had no leverage. Alan made sure to let me know that this was the case. I sat at the Spier wine farm in front of Alan racking my little brain for a way out. I sat in silence and stared at the wall for what must have been five minutes while Alan played on his phone for a while and after I had accepted my fate I got up and walked out. I left Alan with two demands: 

1. I was to be paid out in cash, in full, as soon as the sale agreement was signed.   
2. I was going to be in control of any and all press and media around the exit.   
   

If I was leaving without a company, I was going to make fucking sure that I was going to control the message and not the two conspirators who had broken me.  
You would think that it would be easy street to the sale of the business but let’s be honest, at this point in my story you should have come to recognise that nothing is ever simple. Once I had met with Alan and I understood Vinents’s game, the only people left to consult and confide in were my investors at 4Di Capital. I called Justin and met with the 4Di team on Thursday after seeing Alan. Alan decided to stop paying my salary at some point in this mess and tried to renegotiate the exit terms while I was cash strapped and depressed. Vincent insisted that he had nothing to do with this, but why would I believe him at this point in our relationship?  
4Di was as outraged as I was but were much more level headed. They had apparently also been kept in the dark by Alan and Vincent throughout our dealings with them in 2012\. They did not know that this was coming but decided that the best route forward was for us to push on with the sale and for everyone to get paid and get out. I resisted, fought and argued that I could take it all and let Vincent go and join his kin at Mxit. Rightfully, 4Di explained that they had initially backed two jockeys who complemented each other. If Vincent left, their investment would be in me alone with a platform that was barely break even and bleeding users. They were smart, calm and intentional. They helped me exit Motribe with money in my bank account and a tiny semblance of sanity.   
My partnership with Vincent was dead. My friendship with Vincent was over. My business was no longer mine and my team were no longer working with me. I was out and just like that it was over.

## **THE DAY AFTER THE WORST DAY**

On the 29th of October 2012 I found myself lying on a couch watching TV in my underwear. My business partner had just screwed me over and I was left with no business to run, no team to work with, no product to build and no direction in life. I had just signed the agreement to sell Motribe while sitting in my underwear.   
Over the past 70 days I had experienced loss, anger, frustration, elation, confusion and all the emotions one person can reasonably expect to feel in a 70-day period. In August I had been up in Johannesburg and closed a few deals that made our business profitable and by October it was all over and I was out.    
This is not how it was meant to be. This is not how it was meant to end. This is not what I expected when I started this business.   
Depression comes quickly and uncontrollably and I was deep in it. I hadn’t worked since August and the only thing that I did that resembled work was battle for my pay cheque, battle with my investors, battle with my ex-business partner and battle for a fair exit from the buyers. When you are dealing with real loss it is physically and mentally exhausting to have to fight for every little scrap. I just couldn’t understand what had happened, how it had happened so quickly and why it had happened to me. What I should have done was unpack everything calmly and rationally. That’s just not how it works unfortunately. This is how it works:   
I sat and wallowed. I lay in bed. I lay on the couch. Sometimes I lay on the floor. I didn’t put pants on for a few days ... then a few weeks. It was extremely hard to wrap my head around what had happened and drag myself out of it. I was stuck in a brutal and depressing rut that I could not think my way out of. The only way out was through it all. One of the most difficult things about this period was living a double life; the life that everyone saw and the one that I was living. What everyone saw was the success, the media interviews, the press around the Motribe exit and the hype that I was creating. The truth was much more raw. I was depressed and lonely and had nothing but a cash payment that barely covered my debt, rent and expenses for the next few months. This is the blunt truth about many startups exits. This is what an exit often looks like for one of the founders or both.

## **WHAT THE HELL DO I DO NOW?**

In the coming months I would start two businesses. One would be born from the need for money and the other born from the need to be fulfilled. It’s incredibly hard to start, maintain and grow two new businesses simultaneously and I quickly realised that one of them would suffer if both survived.   
One of the most common questions that entrepreneurs ask is: ‘When do I quit?’ There are many, many stories of entrepreneurs who have pushed through tough times, struggled through trials and tribulations and come out on top. Companies that are successful and long lasting have made it through the worst of times and not given up.  
The first business that I started immediately after Motribe showed me the answer to the question ‘When do I quit?’ There is really no simple answer to this question because it’s such a personal one. For me it was about happiness. I know, I know, this sounds like some hippie-dippie shit but it’s the truth. I realised that being unhappy day in and day out with no prospect of change for at least the next three years was enough for me to throw in the towel. It’s important to understand what your breaking point is, what your trigger points are and when you arrive at those points that you have the guts and gumption to walk the fuck away.   
As entrepreneurs we are programmed to look for the opportunity and seek the potential. This allows us to grow something from nothing; it shows us the good that’s in the world and makes us stick with something that others might give up on. But at the same time, this single trait is the driving force behind so many unhappy people. Entrepreneurs who are not willing to quickly kill off a business that may make them unhappy for years because there may be a pot of gold at the end of their business rainbow. Let me pop this balloon right here and right now: there is no pot of gold. There is no big pay day. There is no massive exit. There is no silver bullet that will help you achieve these things.   
What is there? Day to day. Every day there is a grind, every day there is a part of you that thinks there is a better way to do things, better things to do and perhaps a new opportunity on the horizon. What you need to do is find the balance between opportunity and destruction. Destruction comes when opportunity fades and all that is left is torture. The torture of working hard and not smart. The torture of constant struggle with no end in sight. This torture can be slow burning and appear out of nowhere one day. When it appears I suggest you take an immediate hard look at your day to day life, your big picture goals and your tolerance for suffering over a five-year period.   
I reached this exact point about a year into building ForeFront Africa. Everything was working, the business was growing but I was desperately unhappy and needed to get out.   
Sometimes you need to burn it all to the ground and walk away.  
In the turmoil of working with Mxit, trying to save Motribe and being forced out of the business, I was reacquainted with a woman who I had met at Vodacom and who would become my next business partner. Tracy is an extremely confident and well-practised mobile consultant. She understands protocol, bureaucracy and processes in the world of telecommunication (mobile operators and startups), which is a vital skill if you are playing in the big corporate world of Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Tracy was working at Mxit on a consulting contract that was coming to an abrupt end at about the same time as my Motribe hopes were being dashed. Tracy was looking for something to do and I was grasping for any semblance of relevance and meaning. I needed to feel like I had something going after I was left with very little in the Motribe exit.   
On the night that I signed the sale agreement for Motribe I sat on the couch and did nothing unusual; made dinner, watched TV, went to sleep. The next morning Jen made me promise that the next time I started a business if the moment ever came that I was not having fun or wanted out, I would stop immediately. This would prove to be a pivotal promise in the coming year.   
Tracy and I had begun to discuss what we were both going to do next and against my better judgement we decided to start a consulting firm called Forefront Africa. After the incredibly difficult partnership with Vincent I swore to myself that I would take time and build something alone, something for myself and by myself. Partnering with Tracy was a move that I made out of fear. Fear that I wasn’t good enough to go alone. Fear that Vincent was the best part of the co-founding team at Motribe. Fear that whatever I did next required an adult to help me. I definitely jumped in too soon.  	  
Tracy and I would consult to large businesses trying to gain access to mobile networks in key African countries like South Africa, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria. Our first client was WeChat in Africa and fairly quickly after that Tracy managed to sign Clickatell as our second customer. Within weeks of starting we had managed to secure full-time work for both of us.   
My main focus was with WeChat. The mobile chat app from China had just launched in South Africa as the first African country in a roll-out plan that would extend continent-wide. The first country was South Africa partly because Naspers (the global media giant that was founded and is still headquartered in South Africa) owns a chunk of the app, as well as the massive mobile penetration rate in South Africa and the more refined user habits in the market. South Africa is an extremely developed mobile market with smartphone penetration, decent mobile Internet and users who have a hunger to connect. I was tasked with assisting WeChat in brokering mobile network deals to zero rate the service on the network and co-market the product to the network’s customers. What this means in English: I needed to get MTN Nigeria to offer WeChat for free to its customers and to pay to market the product to those users.   
I was working directly with Brett, the man tasked with heading up WeChat for Naspers. Brett has great experience in the mobile space in South Africa but had enough on his plate in SA to handle without expansion plans into the three key African countries aside from SA.   
Without knowing what I was getting into, ForeFront Africa began working on the WeChat strategic plan and execution. Tracy and I began tapping into our ex-Vodacom networks and realised that we had solid ins into Airtel in Kenya, Etisalat and MTN in Nigeria and MTN in Ghana. I was stationed inside of Naspers and sitting right next to Brett as we planned the roll-out for WeChat. What this meant practically is that I would arrive at Naspers at 9am and leave at 5pm and repeat 4 days a week. I was a glorified employee. At the time it was what I needed apparently, because I didn’t mind and didn’t complain for the first few months. I spent the time at Naspers partly working to gain access to mobile networks but also trying to find other clients and grow ForeFront Africa. I was being paid an obscene amount of money to work part time for a big corporate and achieve fairly reasonable goals.   
One of the first trips that I went on for WeChat was to Nigeria to meet with MTN in Nigeria and Etisalat (now called 9Mobile). Naspers doesn’t stuff around when they send people abroad on business trips. You fly in business class, you are provided with security escorts to ensure your safety and as an individual you pay for nothing.   
These trips are always intense. You travel to a place like Lagos and it’s buzzing with activity. Everyone tells you how dangerous it is, how cramped, how bad the traffic is and how you should never walk alone if you’re white because you’ll get kidnapped. Hell, I’ve heard worse things about Johannesburg. Tracy, Brett and I managed to make great inroads into MTN and Etisalat. These deals always take months longer than necessary and involved dealing with multiple staff changes at MTN throughout the process.   
Our deal with them was no exception. What could have (and should have) taken a few months ended up taking me almost 12 months to get done. Ultimately the deal closed and WeChat launched in Nigeria but, to be honest, I wasn’t personally invested in this at all. I was simply doing what I was being paid to do while I believed I was building up a good base for my consulting firm. The truth was that I did not like the business I was building and didn’t like the work I was doing because it was for a massive multinational corporation that acquired its wealth through apartheid era profits and business practices.   
You see, Naspers was founded in 1915 and was originally called De Nationale Pers Beperkt (National Press Ltd). It was a newspaper publisher that supported Afrikaner nationalism (the apartheid government) and because it did so, over the years it amassed a fortune and built an empire. It’s an entirely different business today and one that is mightily impressive globally, but I was starting to break under the pressure of the corporate game and the fact that I wasn’t building something for myself.   
Tracy, on the other hand, was thriving. She was working in an industry she loved and knew intimately and continued to push and grow our client base. The next client that Tracy managed to hook for us was Imperial Logistics. Her husband had recently sold a business to the Imperial group and provided us with a great in. Imperial had consolidated a few businesses into a single entity called Resolve.   
Resolve is filled with very large men. I mean that quite literally. There are a lot of very big, rugby playing Afrikaans men who work at and run Imperial and the Resolve businesses. These guys are extremely proficient at what they do: logistics. They know how to truck trucks, they know how to organise a warehouse and build the technology behind the warehouses. They know how to sell cars, rent cars, import cars, export cars and do anything that has to do with cars. Imperial struggles with innovative solutions to problems that they can see and know are soon going to destroy their businesses. This appeared to be more my kind of client. I could effect change in a business that seemed to be interested in the future and bringing in new talent.   
The truth was less glamorous than it appeared. We were brought in to dress up an old business that wanted new clothes. In their eyes, innovation could be the new clothes that made them look shiny, new and attractive. New clothes don’t make the person inside of them any different. To these guys, it didn’t matter how ugly the business was, if we could put a layer of innovation on top of the ugliness then the business would change. I was the lipstick tasked with applying the layer of innovation to a business that deep down did not want to change. It’s hard to redirect a multibillion rand business when what you are actually telling them is to forgo profits so they can benefit from the shift in the next decade or so. Oh, and there is no promise of success. That’s not what giant men want to understand. What they want is a quick fix to show their bosses and make them look good.   
While travelling between Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria I was also being asked by Imperial to fly up to Johannesburg on the red eye flight at 5am and then drive to Pretoria for a full day or two of work and then move on to my next trip. The tough thing about consulting is that your clients expect you to work for them like they are your only client. Unfortunately this is just not possible and you are bound to let someone down. Tracy was committed to the idea of working with Imperial because of their size, the potential for us to grow our business within theirs and because of the potential for a nice exit for us. I was extremely sceptical but decided that I should trust Tracy and go along for the ride.  
ForeFront Africa was not the only business I started after Motribe. The other business that I started would become the one that I dedicated the next five years to. The other business that I started was a sock company. It was pretty nuts to the people closest to me. I wanted to manufacture and sell socks. Often the most promising ideas are the ones that other people think are crazy and flat out won’t work. I had this in spades when I started NicSocks.com.  
While still with ForeFront Africa, I would go from client to client and then have to work on my other fledgling startup on the side, in my lunchtimes and while the clients weren’t looking at my laptop screen. All I wanted to do was focus on NicSocks.com and make it a real thing. I was more engaged and dedicated to this small side hustle than I was to clients paying ForeFront Africa hundreds of thousands of rands to work on their problems. My enthusiasm dictated my attention and my focus. I should have realised then that ForeFront Africa was doomed. And for me, doomed it was.   
In spite of knowing what I felt, I continued to pitch clients and grow our topline revenue with Tracy. Consulting is a great business because your overheads are extremely low when you start out. We had two people (Tracy and Nic) and an office. Even the office was unnecessary but, smartly, Tracy had a feeling that she needed to keep me focused and thought she could do this by renting us an office space at the V\&A Waterfront Clock Tower. We paid a ridiculous amount for two desks in a shared office area. I would come in once or twice a month and Tracy would try really hard to keep me focused.   
As the months wore on my attention shifted away from my clients and towards my own business. However, we continued to perform and grow. So much so that Imperial Logistics made an offer to buy our little consulting firm. The deal was simple: they would acquire our business on an earn-out basis. Every year, depending on how well we performed, we would be paid out for the equity that we owned. This was a three year earn-out period for millions of rands.   
It was a fantastic deal that we (Tracy) worked hard to make happen. The Resolve/Imperial boys club negotiated hard and were aware of my attention deficit disorder when it came to working with big corporates. They knew they had to tie me down or they weren’t going to get the best from me. Ultimately, we closed the deal and were ready to get back to work. We would continue to grow our client base, employ more consultants, place them with the clients and earn out over three years.   
‘It’s only three years,’ I remember thinking to myself when we finally managed to reach a deal with the Resolve CEO, Heinrich. Throughout the negotiation Heinrich kept referring to NicSocks.com as my ‘little business on the side’ and this really got under my skin. I kept thinking ‘fuck you’, every time he said it. It made me angry and grew my disdain for the attitude that these guys had for small business, entrepreneurs and me personally. They just didn’t understand that anyone would want to do anything that didn’t involve the kind of scale that they had. They were the be all and end all of business in their eyes and I was stupid to continue building this ‘little sock company’.   
I would see Heinrich years later at a conference and the first words out of his condescending mouth were: ‘How’s that little sock business of yours?’ I laughed and said that things were fine but made a point to remember the smug look on his face as I walked away.   
Tracy and I continued to pitch clients. We spoke with a music company in Ghana, we pitched the Weather Channel, we talked with Diageo and many others once we knew there was an earn-out on the cards. But whatever we did just didn’t motivate me. Part of the deal with Resolve was that we rebranded ForeFront Africa to Resolve Mobile. Tracy retained ForeFront Africa brand as her own to use down the line. We would take on anything to do with mobile in the Resolve business. We would have access to their developers and resources and, according to the higher-ups, we could build anything we wanted to build and solve whatever problems we wanted to solve.   
Still, none of it motivated me because I had seen this all before at Vodacom. What they really mean when they say ‘anything’ is anything they tell you. What they really mean when they give you freedom is company mandated freedoms within restrictive boundaries. On one of my trips to Ghana I recall sitting at the desk in my hotel room in Accra working on NicSocks.com an hour before I was scheduled to go into a negotiation with MTN. I stood up, put on my NicSocks and snapped a few photos in the hotel mirror so that I could post on Instagram and grow the followers for my business. I was more engaged with growing my follower count than I was for preparing for a massive negotiation with the biggest mobile network on the continent. My time at Resolve Mobile was over. Mentally, I was now working for a big corporate called Resolve Mobile that I no longer owned or ran and I was not winning the battle for my freedom.    
Then one day I had a massive argument with Heinrich about flights to Johannesburg. When most old school corporates are paying for their employees to fly anywhere they insist that you take the earliest flight possible, called the ‘red eye’ flight. They do this so that you can land and be at work by 8am and get in a full day of work. Basically, they don’t want a flight to screw them out of a few good hours of your time.   
I refused to fly the red eye. I fundamentally believe that waking up before 4am for most people does more damage to the quality of their work when they land than anything else. I’d rather fly at 10am and have meetings by 1pm and work an extra day than be dead tired and ineffective all day (or all week). Heinrich disagreed and I was given a stern talking to about wasting their time and money on late flights. I shut my mouth, dropped my lip and got through the day.   
I flew back to Cape Town the next day, landed and relayed the story to Jen. She looked at me and asked me if I remembered what I had told her after Motribe ended. Of course I remembered, but I had been avoiding it because the potential of an earn-out was in the front of my mind. I was two years away from exiting with much more money than I had made at Motribe, the deal was done and we were already on the path. But Jen persisted and ultimately I broke and realised that I fucking hated what I was stuck doing. I hated the consulting I was doing, I hated most of the clients I was working with, I hated the company we had sold to and hated the old white men I was being forced to listen to every day. I was out.   
There and then I called Tracy and told her that I was out. I gave her all of my shares basically for free and then I called Heinrich. I told him that I was quitting Resolve Mobile, giving all my shares to Tracy and rather pursuing my little sock company. He laughed at me and told me that I was making a massive mistake. Not the first time I’d heard that in my life.   
As soon as I was off the phone and officially out of the business I felt a massive sense of relief. I was free. Leaving Motribe in the way that I had was brutal but to then be in a place that I hated 18 months later was patently unacceptable to me. I had built a business chasing money and it ate me up every day. I enjoyed the work that I did over that 18-month period but it was not worth my freedom to build the things I wanted to build. Quitting was the easiest decision that I made that year. One phone call to freedom.   
I’m sure that Tracy went on to make good money out of the Resolve group and she deserved it. It takes a unique person to grind out time at a corporate, hoard money and leave without looking back. My desire to control my time, what I do with my time and what I build with my skill overrides my desire for money. That was the lesson that Resolve Mobile taught me and it was an invaluable lesson that came at the perfect time. Sometimes you just have to burn it all down and walk away to be happy.

## **I STARTED A SOCK COMPANY ... SERIOUSLY**

After the Motribe exit was concluded I received a small payout from the sale of this company. It wasn’t much. It was just enough for me to start my next business.  
Actually finding a new business to start was an entirely different story. I began meeting with people, talking to friends and family trying to see what gaps existed that I could potentially build a business to fill. I looked at everything and anything. Here are some of the ideas I had that I didn’t end up building: 

* **CycleSend** – a courier company that provides bicycles to unemployed people and allowed them to pick up and deliver parcels in city centres.   
* **CellSell** – a second-hand cellphone resale platform.   
* **African Porn** – a website dedicated to porn made in Africa by Africans for Africans. There’s a lot of porn out there but it is very Western focused. I kind of regret not getting into this particular business because I still think there’s a massive gap for body positive, inclusive and real porn, especially on the African continent.   
* **SpiceMatch** – you tell us what spices you have and we tell you what you can do with them.   
* **Kulista** – a list review platform like Zomato but before Zomato entered the South African market.

These were just some of the ideas that I tried to force into my world. The truth is that when you are down and out it’s hard to come up with relevant ideas that you want to spend the next five years (or a lifetime) building. So I began to think about the things that bothered me specifically, not problems that I felt the world needed solved.   
For a long time I have hated men’s fashion. I even hate the word fashion. Fashion is for runways, cool men with ponytails, six-pack abs and dark tans. Fashion is not for me. I hate that I walk into clothing stores and 80 per cent of the product is for women (because historically women are the spenders) and the 20 per cent of clothing that remains for men is all dark and boring. I thought that there may be something in there for me to build. I was, again, lying on my couch in my socks and underwear when Jen pointed out that I had been complaining about the shitty quality of the fun socks I was wearing and perhaps there was something there. Perhaps we could start making socks in Cape Town that were better quality. This really started to move my brain and get me thinking.   
I decided it was time to make a move so I took R5 000 (±$400) and started NicSocks. To me, socks represent the very basis of dressing. When I begin the process of getting dressed in the morning I put my underwear on first and then my socks. I wanted people across the world to sit down and pull up a pair of the brightest, most comfortable, most colourful socks that I had designed and knitted in South Africa. I wanted to build a style company that dressed men from the ground up. I wanted to help men feel alive and start their day off with a smile when they looked down at the socks on their feet. I wanted to sell socks\!  
I chose R5 000 as the capital investment because it’s a number that many people are able to save over a period of time. If you save R500 for 10 months, you’ve got seed capital to start a business. That’s what I wanted to prove.   
The model was simple. Use R5 000 to fund the business, spend six weeks building the business and then spend the next 30 days trying to make back the R5 000 and a profit of some kind. If I could make the money back and make a profit then there was proof of traction in the market and I could commit more time and effort to the company. If the business didn’t make a profit I would tee up another R5 000 and start again in the cycle of six weeks and 30 days until one of the ideas worked.   
It wasn’t a foolproof methodology. It wasn’t a tested system but it managed to get me off the couch, put pants on and get excited about something again. One of the things that helped the business catch on in the early days was our focus on the idea of a sock subscription. In simple terms, you pay me every month and I send you a random pair of socks every month. I’ve tried many iterations of this model over the years and I am very fond of the idea of recurring automated revenue. Subscriptions made sense to me with socks because everyone needs new socks.  
People often ask me why I called the company NicSocks. People who know me well will attest to the fact that I struggle to stay anywhere for too long. I move house a lot, I move jobs a lot and I generally struggle to sit still. It’s just something that I have always done. So when Jen and I were discussing names for the sock company she was adamant that if I didn’t include my own name in the branding I would get bored and move on too quickly. She suggested that by branding myself into the DNA of the business I would be more committed to the outcome of the company. Not surprisingly, she was right so we called the business NicSocks. At the time we were not the only people in the world selling brightly coloured socks. I had been wearing another brand of socks (the only one I could find at the time) and as a reaction to their average design and bad quality I decided to make NicSocks the best pair of socks you could find.   
Jen found a manufacturer in Cape Town. We called them up and scheduled a meeting.   
I can’t imagine how difficult it was for Jen to be around me while I was wallowing and depressed after the Motribe debacle. And, holy shit, did I wallow\! But to her credit, she knew how to engage my mind, ambition and drive and whip me out of the hell that I was putting myself through.   
Jen drove me to that first meeting with our manufacturer and sat with me as we listened to them tell me that they couldn’t make the bright and colourful socks I wanted to make.   
I am not a fashion entrepreneur. I am not trained in anything to do with design, manufacturing, retail or fashion. I just decided that I was sick and tired of men having no variety in stores and socks being boring. As I sat and listened to the owner of the factory tell me why this was not going to work I realised that I had absolutely no cooking clue what I was doing sitting at a sock factory trying to have brightly coloured socks made. It was one of the most liberating feelings I can remember experiencing. I didn’t know what the rules were so I had no reason to believe that I couldn’t make colourful socks or that they wouldn’t sell. All I knew is that the world needed more colour and men needed more options for their feet than the five-pack at Woolworths.     
Back then I had absolutely no idea what I could and could not do in sock making. I had no clue what was appropriate design, what their machines were capable of doing, how much it would cost to make a pair, to ship a pair, to pack or to warehouse socks, or anything else for that matter. I didn’t even know how to submit my designs to them; on a piece of paper? A sock template? Some other interesting way? It’s a liberating feeling to not realise that you don’t know and you have so much to learn and so much to disrupt. People often ask how I went from running a mobile Internet company to a style company. It was actually pretty easy to get started: I just drove to the sock manufacturer, sat down and had a conversation. It would be the next five years that were difficult and interesting. Not the start.    
I went home that night and produced three sock designs. A barbershop pole was the very first one. You know, when you walk into a barbershop you see that pole at the entrance that spins the spiral of red, white and blue stripes that curl up endlessly? That’s the barbershop pole design that has become one of our iconic designs. I sent the designs to the factory and shortly afterwards I received a response saying that they couldn’t make the socks. Having met the team now, I was sure that they could make them, but they didn’t want to or perhaps didn’t know how to. I called Denys and asked him if he couldn’t make the socks or just wouldn’t make the socks. Turns out that I was right. They could actually make them but had just never really done it before and were reluctant to try because they didn’t believe that the socks would sell and that I would be a flash in the pan sock guy and waste their time. I insisted that Denys make me anything he could; one sock, one pair, any of each of the three designs. He ended up agreeing to try it out. Two weeks later we collected and paid for the sock samples and I was on my way.   
The next two weeks were spent designing the NicSocks.com website. I spent some of my R5 000 capital having a logo designed.  
I spent some of the money on packaging and then started thinking about launching NicSocks into the world. My idea of packaging back then was really just bright orange tissue paper with a sticker to hold the wrapped socks together. It was simple but extremely effective. The final and crucial step in the launch process was to partner with a brand that had a massive audience and get my socks in front of as many humans as possible.   
Fortunately, I knew one of the founders of Superbalist.com (which at the time was still called Citymob.com) so I called Luke and we agreed to launch a NicSocks sale on Citymob. It was probably the best decision I made early on. That single launch would propel us into a brand.   
Once the site was set up, the packaging was ready and the deal was negotiated with Citymob, we went live. On 19th November 2012 I launched a sock company. Three weeks after I had been left with no choice but to sell one business, I was starting another.   
The night before the sale launched I was again sitting in my underwear and watching TV (it’s extremely hot in Cape Town in November). This time there was a glimmer of excitement and hope. The potential of what might come and the hope that it would actually work out the way you planned.   
The sale with Citymob went extremely well. We sold hundreds of pairs of socks in about ten days and our R5 000 investment turned into R30 000 in sales. I had proven traction. I had proven that I could launch a business in six weeks and with R5 000\. I had made a small profit (I wasn’t paying myself a salary but I covered the initial investment and had ±R25 000 left\!) and I was feeling better about life.   
All I needed now was 400 pairs of socks knitted, picked, packed and shipped to the customers who had bought them. I didn’t realise it at the time but this single sale would go on to define the next five years of my life. 

Just like that, I went from getting screwed out of one business to starting a new one. That’s how quick it can happen if you let it.

## **KNOW WHEN TO FOCUS**

At the time of the first sale with CityMob and the initial traction of NicSocks I was still trying to find my feet in the world and dabbling in a few different business opportunities. On top of that, I still needed to earn a monthly income because I had spread my Motribe money out into various opportunities. There was no time to sit on my ass and bask in the glory of cash in the bank. That cash was going fast.   
This meant that I was still consulting for clients to try to make money here and there. I was working with Tracy to build ForeFront Africa and travelling across the continent while sales at NicSocks.com were trickling in. Fortunately, Jen was willing to pick up the slack for me when I was travelling and she would pick, pack and ship the orders for me.   
\[If you aren’t sure what I mean when I keep saying pick/pack/ship then let me quickly explain how it works. When you place an order on a website for a product you love, let’s say one pair of my incredible bamboo socks, that order is sent to a real person. That person views the order, walks into a warehouse and finds the pair you ordered – this is the picking. Then they take that item over to the packing area of the warehouse where they put the socks in our company packaging – you guessed it, that’s the packing. Lastly, this person needs to write a waybill for your order so the courier company can come and collect and then deliver your socks – and that is the ship. Pick, pack, ship.\]   
Back to the point. NicSocks was a side hustle for me. It stayed that way for nearly two years. I was building a consulting firm that was earning me significantly more money but was becoming increasingly more complicated with new partners.   
The business began to grow nicely. I focused on expanding our subscriber base. Initially I wanted to meet our customers so I set up a pickup point in Woodstock, Cape Town. Every week between 10am and 2pm I would sit at a tea shop with customers’ orders and wait for them to come and pick them up. I’d meet the customers, get an understanding of exactly why they purchased a subscription, who it was for, how they heard about us, what they thought about our socks and so on. It was a fantastic way for me to gain insights into my customer base, but ultimately that kind of engagement is unsustainable as you scale.   
Our ecommerce sales were really starting to take off. This was mostly driven by traditional media, if you can believe that. I discovered that the more exposure I received in magazines and on radio and TV shows, the better our website did. There was a direct correlation. So I started to work my way into as many shows and publications as possible. I was interviewed on 5FM, 702 and Cape Talk, tons of local radio stations; I appeared on Top Billing and did interviews for countless magazines (online and offline). The Top Billing feature just about made our sales numbers for that year. The incredible response was surprising because I honestly believed that TV was dead. It is not dead in South Africa. I was getting recognised at the airport when I was travelling within the country. I am a dark skinned, heavily bearded and heavily tattooed man. When people stare at me at the airport I begin to worry. I start to get twitchy. Eventually after a group of people had been staring at me in the check-in queue for about ten minutes I decided to ask them what the hell was up. They kindly explained that they had seen me on Top Billing the week before. I stopped panicking that someone was about to arrest me and decided to bask in the hype for the time being. That TV spot boosted our online sales by more than 200 per cent. Traditional media isn’t dead, it just needs to be used in the right way.   
I was desperate to change the status of NicSocks from side hustle to full-time focus, but like many entrepreneurs I was unsure about when to make the full-time leap. There was a very key and consistent feeling that kept nagging at me. The feeling that I was neglecting the most important thing that I was building. I would be sitting with Resolve Mobile clients in Kenya and sneaking in work on NicSocks. I would be talking to the biggest mobile networks on the continent and thinking about the customer support request I had left unanswered for too long about how to wash bamboo socks. My focus was always on NicSocks. That was the feeling. That was the indication that it was time to devote my attention to my tiny sock startup. Even as I write these words, I completely understand how nuts this is. I left a consulting firm that I started and that was paying me a six figure salary to build a sock company in Cape Town. What could I do? I was dreaming about socks. Surely that’s motivation enough to dedicate your waking hours to your next adventure?  
My answer to the question ‘When do I focus on my side project?’ is that you focus when you can think of nothing else but your side project.

## **RAISING MONEY AGAIN**

I have already spoken in depth about raising money for your business but it’s relevant to have this conversation again and in a different context. Raising money for NicSocks.com was the right decision for the business when I started to look for funding. I put my feelers out to my network of investors and high-wealth individuals who might be interested. I met with angel investors and VC funds locally and abroad and realised that there was interest.   
This fund-raise was a bit different. The key to raising money this time round was my track record as an entrepreneur, the traction that NicSocks had and the story of how we hustled to build out version 1 of the business. My network played a key role in helping me find the investors I needed. Never underestimate the value of your network. I’m not talking about your Facebook feed or your LinkedIn connections. These are false networks that make you feel good but don’t have any material effect on your life. I’m talking about the network of people that you groom over many years. People you trust, people who trust you and people who you believe you can call on when you need help, advice or, in my case, funding.   
Nurturing this network of people has probably been my single biggest accomplishment over the past 15 years of building businesses. I have made a lot of enemies but I believe that creating enemies has led me to find the people who I would lie in a foxhole with. In my experience, you cannot build a meaningful network if everyone is your buddy. Sometimes you have to break a few connections to create new and more important ones. Never underestimate the value of the people you surround yourself with and how you treat them. With absolute certainty, I can say that you will need to call on this network as you progress in your life so don’t abuse people, don’t use people, be genuine and offer up value as much as you ask for it. 

I wanted to raise funding for NicSocks because I wanted to focus. I was getting increasingly frustrated that I was working part time on my startup, and in my experience the way to focus is to raise funding.   
After a few months of continued growth and building our customer base and range, a few things started to click into place. Jen was an ever-present force in the growth of NicSocks.com. She kept me focused, kept me on strategy and really helped the business become what it is today. At this stage NicSocks.com was operating out of the spare bedroom in our house in Cape Town. We were both working fiercely to keep up with growth and scale things effectively. We were busting out of the spare room at a rapid rate. Every wall was lined top to bottom with socks. We needed to move out of our house and into a bigger place with more space. We needed more space because we were ordering much more stock for the website and had to start planning for scale and the next phase of the business. Not only were we starting to think about the business but we decided that it was time that we became a couple who works together. That was a big decision, but one that I think defined the success of the coming years. Without Jen managing operations, NicSocks.com would never have grown the way it did.

The first thing that clicked in relation to funding was a conversation with an old friend of mine, Adii. Adii had just exited his business and was keen to start investing in local startups. He and I began discussing what that might look like and how he could be involved.   
Adii and I met when I was building my blog, SA Rocks. I had built the site using WordPress (WP) and Adii was quickly establishing himself as a rockstar in the WP community. I approached him cold to see if he’d help me redesign the SA Rocks theme. He and I struck up a relationship that would last over a decade. Adii did not end up building the new theme for SA Rocks but, funnily enough, Adii’s future business partner Mark did help me with the SA Rocks redesign. The two of them would go on to build one of the world’s leading ecommerce platforms, WooCommerce. It’s incredible to me that I met both of these guys more than ten years ago and I’m still great friends with both of them. It’s incredible how quickly a chance meeting can turn into a ten-year friendship and how those chance meetings help to grow your network.   
Adii agreed to become the very first NicSocks investor. I wish it was more complicated than that, but it wasn’t. Adii and I had a good relationship; he knew me as an entrepreneur and trusted that I would do everything I could to turn his initial investment into more money.   
My network would again play an integral part in helping me find my next investor for the business.   
Danillo is a friend of mine. He’s a fantastic photographer who was starting up his own side hustle ecommerce company. Danillo’s dad Ricky had been to hotel school many years ago and met a guy named Rolf. Rolf had moved from South Africa to Australia and had success investing in and assisting an ecommerce company there, so Danillo and Ricky met up with Rolf to talk about their ecommerce project. Rolf did not end up investing in Danillo’s business, but Danillo had mentioned that they were stocking socks from NicSocks.com. Rolf was interested in what I was doing and we were introduced.   
I met Rolf for the first time at the Cape Grace Hotel. This kind of investor meeting is my favourite kind. It’s where I shine. I know my business. I know the pressure points, our analytics and have a good memory for numbers and figures that can really show that I am paying attention to my industry, competitors and my own business. After just one tea (Rolf rarely drinks coffee at our meetings) I had cemented a relationship with Rolf that led to him investing in NicSocks.com. If you’ve ever gone into an investor meeting wondering what you should prepare beforehand, here are some quick-fire tips: 

* **Know your subject matter.** It’s imperative to know what your business is about and to understand the intricacies of what you do and how you do it.   
* **Understand the competitive landscape.** Don’t go into a meeting with a potential investor thinking you’re the only company in the world doing what you do. That’s naive and very rarely true.   
* **Be honest.** You will not have all the answers and the investors don’t expect you to. They expect you to be willing to admit you don’t know and to learn as fast as you can.   
* **Know what you need.** Do you need funding? A network? Dealflow? A mentor? Pick something. If it is funding that you need then it’s probably a good idea to know how much you are looking to raise and what you plan to do with that money. ‘Salaries’ is not a good reason to raise money. ‘Growth’ might be but even this is too broad and vague. Where are you spending the money to grow? How much growth do you need? Is the growth sustainable or backed by the investment? It’s complex so don’t oversimplify this part.    
* **Do not expect it to go well.** The chances of walking away from a first meeting with a handshake deal is probably less than 5 per cent. My meeting with Rolf was an absolutely stunning exception to the rule that you need have 500 meetings to close a single deal. 

The intended use for the money that I raised was for ecommerce growth, product expansion, marketing and hiring of a team. In my experience, it is very rare for money to be used exactly as you plan. The nature of a business is that it’s tumultuous and ever-changing. You have to be able to adapt. Our money would end up being used to open physical retail stores, but more on that a little bit later.   
Let me ask you a simple question: What are the things that you love about your business? While you think about the answer, let me ask a follow-up question: do you think that raising funding is going to enhance the things you love, or detract from them? This is a key question that I have learned to consider after raising money for NicSocks.com, Motribe and Student Wire.   
Raising funding changes everything.   
You think it doesn’t. You hope you’re different. You believe your investors are not like everyone else’s investors. You can hold your breathe and believe this stuff until you are blue in the face but you’d probably be wrong and out of breath.  
Do you want a slow burn business or a fast growth business? You cannot be both. You can’t take on investment and then decide that you want to take 20 years to give your investors a return on their money. It just doesn’t work like that. Not for most of us, anyways. If you’re Jeff Bezos then maybe you’re different. But even Facebook had to give their investors a return and to do this they listed on the stock exchange.   
Raising money is not an achievement. It is not a goal to aspire towards or aim for. Raising money is a strategic move to help you reach your next goal or grow your business or achieve the next milestone. Raising money is not something to be proud of. You might feel like it is. I felt like that each time I’ve raised funding in the past but ultimately when you raise money you enter an entirely different business. Your business becomes very focused on administration and operations. You focus on returns and managing a board and your investor relationships. At NicSocks.com we instituted a board of directors, formalised our accounting practices, had monthly report back sessions and things became very serious very quickly. I was definitely not prepared for these things, but at the time it all felt right so I ploughed ahead.   
Rolf came on board and joined the funding round with Adii. NicSocks was rocking and ready to go. We had some traction in a difficult market and went from selling 4 000 pairs of socks in year one to selling nearly 100 000 in a year. The growth was banging on and we had our sights set on global sock domination\! Keep in mind, we’re a still just a sock company selling online in South Africa out of the spare room in my house.

## **REBRANDING IS OVERRATED**

Two years after I had launched NicSocks I was working on the business full time, raising funding and growing consistently. Things were going well but I had a nagging feeling that I was missing something or heading down a path that I couldn’t come back from. One of our competitors in the sock space has always been Happy Socks. It’s such a great name and I’ve always been jealous of how simple and memorable it is. But there was something that bugged me about the name as we pushed on with NicSocks.   
After a lot of consideration I realised that it was the word ‘Socks’ that bothered me so much. I didn’t like that they referred to their product in the name of the product. When you position your entire business around a particular word that is a product then how do you expand? How do you branch into new products? Well, I proved to be right and Happy Socks started selling underwear. Can you guess what they called this product? You got it: Happy Socks Underwear. Now don’t get me wrong, this worked for them because they have such a strong brand to begin with. If this was going to work for me at NicSocks I was going to have to spend a lot more money building out the brand and gaining market share. I decided that I didn’t want to build a sock company for the next 20 years. I wanted to give myself options and allow us the opportunity to pivot when we needed to.   
I decided to rebrand the company.   
This is a big deal for a young and small company trying to make inroads into a new market. Bright, colourful, fun bamboo socks are very tough to sell in a market that is as conservative as South Africa. So changing the company name in year two was going to be risky.   
I decided that I needed some advice and, as fate would have it, the company that helped us launch our socks, CityMob, had just rebranded to Superbalist. I called Luke up and arranged a meeting to discuss the Superbalist rebrand.   
Luke was incredibly open about their experience but he gave me one piece of advice that really resonated: nobody gives a shit.   
Another friend of mine, many years later, would give me advice that ties into the above quite directly: what’s big in your world is not big in *the* world. 

In relation to my concerns about rebranding NicSocks here’s the summary. Do it because nobody cares. I thought I had this massive brand to defend but in truth I had possibly only sold to a few thousand customers and my business was in its infancy at two years old (I still think we’re in infancy phase and we’re five years old now), so new customers aren’t going to know who NicSocks was if you rebrand. I pushed ahead. For my entire life people have struggled to pronounce my surname: Haralambous. If you are reading this and sounding out the surname right now let me give you a helping hand; pronounce it as follows: Hara-Lam-Bous. Haralambous. Easy. Or not. For as long as I can remember everyone called me Nic Harry. Not surprisingly, it’s the same shortening that my uncle and father were given by their friends: ‘Harry’ in place of Haralambous. And so NicSocks became Nic Harry.   
The rebranding took place exactly two years after we started the company. I sent out an email to our database and you’ll never guess what happened: nothing. We didn’t lose sales, we didn’t lose customers, no one even replied to the message to say they liked/hated the new name. We carried on trading, business as usual, and have never looked back.   
Thankfully, this rebrand allowed us to expand our product offering and today we manufacture and sell bamboo socks, T-shirts and underwear as well as specific handmade limited edition style items that we craft ourselves. I think it would have been quite difficult to sell NicSocks Umbrellas. But Nic Harry’s range of limited edition matching socks and umbrellas are a fan favourite.

## **COMPETITORS ARE OVERRATED**

NicSocks was not the most unique idea in the world. As I’ve mentioned already, when I started it was a reaction to a competitor being overpriced and under-delivering on quality. I am in no way owning the funky sock niche or concept as one that I came up with. I didn’t. Since I launched NicSocks in South Africa in 2012 there has been a non-stop rolling show of competitors that have started up too. Probably two or three of these sock companies each year since we started. That’s a lot of copycats copying a copycat.   
I have always held a very specific view of competition: they don’t know your plan and they can’t execute your strategy better than you can. You are building **your** business, not theirs. It’s important to stay focused on that. They might be able to execute their plan better than you can execute yours, but that’s something different entirely. I am often asked how I feel about brand XYZ copying our designs, our business model, our store strategy, our wholesale moves, our corporate play or whatever the next innovation might be and the truth of the matter is that I have no feelings towards competitors. I’m sure that when I started to compete with Happy Socks, they didn’t care about me because I couldn’t execute their strategy better than they could. I had to execute my own strategy.   
At one point I actually met one of the founders of Happy Socks. It was at the launch of a newly redesigned Fabiani store in Cape Town and Happy Socks was invited. I was not invited but a friend of mine didn’t want to go and thought that it would be good for me to pop in. So I did. I was introduced to one of the founders of Happy Socks and it was explained that I also run a sock company. He looked at me, did not shake my hand or greet me but instead turned to walk away, flapped his hand in the air and said: ‘Pffft, there’s one of you in all of my countries’, and that was the time I met Happy Socks. No so happy after all.   
I was not surprised by this interaction. This is how it happens in startup land. Arrogance and ego are rife. That single interaction has provided fuel to my fire for quite some time. In a very positive way, I thrive on being the underdog. I thrive when people expect the worst of me and underestimate my capabilities. The Happy Socks guy probably didn’t give me a second thought and that’s exactly how it should be. He shouldn’t care about competition because he has his own plan and is going to stick to it.   
When I meet my competitors I don’t show the same level of disdain for their existence, but it doesn’t bother me that they exist. Generally I’m actually quite helpful to other entrepreneurs. The reason is simple: a rising tide lifts all ships. Selling socks is not a zero sum game. People don’t buy socks from one company forever. Most people have two feet and that means there is a very large market for all of us to play in. When I found the South African market to be too small, I started opening up other countries and that had very little to do with my competitors’ moves and more to do with my strategy for growth. You cannot spend your time worrying about what your competition is doing because then you will be left with no time to work on your own business. Ignore them and be the best at what you do.   
That’s not to say that competitors don’t matter. They matter. They matter the most when you make strategic mistakes and they are there to step in. I made a mistake about four years into Nic Harry. I had hired my mother Stasi to work with us at Nic Harry and she had moved down to Cape Town to help us grow the wholesale part of our business. In the short time she worked with us we grew to being stocked in nearly 40 retailers across South Africa. At this point the retailers were struggling to make payments on time, they were battling to maintain the high standards for my product that I had laid out in our agreements by not merchandising effectively and in my head they had become the enemy of our growth and profit strategies.   
We debated at length what the plan should be. We were struggling to manage their expectations and keep up with stock demands. The margins on wholesale are significantly lower than selling through our own channels. Our two stores were flying and we were making a lot of profit through them. Wholesale was looking less and less fun and fruitful. My board began to apply pressure for me to get rid of our wholesale business and focus on stores because of the higher margins. As you’ll see, we were about to supercharge our store strategy. Financially, I was not interested in the low margins of the wholesale business and the stress coming from the retailers finally tipped me over the edge.   
I woke up one day and told Stasi that we were out of the wholesale business and it was her job to inform her customers. At the time it felt like the right move because there was a lot going on but eventually I realised that what I had done was create a vacuum for my competitors to fill. Our socks sold really well in most of our 40 or so stockists and when we left they had to find an alternative. I honestly hadn’t thought of this as a problem. I believed that when we pulled out, that would be it for socks in their stores. That was stupid and naive. Stasi had worked for almost two years building up this side of the business and in one morning I destroyed our lead and handed it over to our competitors.   
This perfectly illustrates my point that you should focus on your strategy and not someone else’s. Sure, my decision was bad, but it was mine to make. I didn’t react to a competitor’s move. They might have reacted that way when I left the door open. But what I knew about wholesale also left me feeling OK that they now had to battle through the low margin, high admin business of wholesale. Since ending those retail relationships I’ve spent a significant portion of my time meeting with the same retailers and rebuilding those relationships in new ways. It’s never too late to admit wrongdoing in an open and honest way. Part of admitting that I made a mistake was contacting Stasi and acknowledging the incorrect move. This was a particularly difficult series of events for me. Not only did my move strategically damage our business, but it led to my mom having to relocate cities and leave Nic Harry. I emailed Stasi a few weeks after she left the company and after I had taken some time to reflect. Upon reflection, I realised that I had acted too quickly, taken on advice from too many people and lost focus of my team and what they were telling me. This was my email to Stasi:

*Hey,*   
*I’ve learned over the years to be quick to acknowledge my mistakes.*   
*Wholesale has been one of these mistakes. I shouldn’t have pulled us out of all the stores that you and I worked so hard to get in to.*   
*I listened to my board/finance people telling me there was no margin in it. What it did was open a huge gap for our competitors to eat our lunch and blaze a trail into the market we opened.*   
*So, I am very sorry that I pulled the rug from under the work you were doing. It was definitely the wrong move for us and has set back brand progress.*   
*Thought it was worth mentioning.*   
*Nic*

You can’t win ’em all. I definitely lost this particular battle.

## **LOOK UP**

Around the same time as the rebrand was taking place I was having coffee with a friend of mine, Simon. We walked through Cape Town CBD towards the coffee shop. We found the coffee shop, sat down and ordered coffee. Just then the owner of the building came in and he and Simon struck up a conversation because they were old friends. Greg started to tell us about the store next to the coffee shop that was giving him so much trouble. The tenant hadn’t paid the rent and was being evicted and he was thinking about taking the store and using it as an office. Simon looked and me and, without any reference to me, said: ‘I bet that would make an amazing sock store.’ That’s how we found the very first Nic Harry physical retail space. I literally stumbled into it.   
Initially, I declined Simon’s suggestion and said that we weren’t ready for physical retail. Greg then told us that the rent was R5 000 a month and I immediately changed my tune thinking this was a completely affordable figure and if it all went to shit, we could put up a banner in the windows advertising our online store and it would go down as R5 000 a month advertising cost. No harm, no foul.   
Greg initially said he wasn’t that keen to have a small independent retailer who was unreliable moving in, so thanks, but no thanks. I gave up the thought and carried on with life. At this time Jen and I have moved into a house in Woodstock that has three bedrooms, the biggest of which was our office and warehouse. We were home a few nights later and I received a call from Simon at about 8pm. I answered and he said: ‘You’ve got a store.’ I had no clue what he was talking about so I asked what he meant and he said that he was out, bumped into Greg and after a short conversation Greg had decided that he wanted us to have the retail space in the building. I looked at Jen and agreed over the phone. We were opening our first physical retail store\!  
On the 23rd of June 2015 we signed our very first retail lease agreement for a store at 66 Wale Street in Cape Town CBD. Lots of scrambling ensued and a short few weeks later we were open. Our launch party took place on 18th August 2015 and sales began to fly in. We timed everything perfectly. I worked in the Wale Street store six days a week and Jen would help me with shifts here and there to give me a day off my feet and to do some work. At this point in my life I was suffering with stress fractures in both of my shins so opening the store was completely ridiculous for my personal well-being. My right leg was in one of those medical moon boots that keep your leg in a specific position. Every day I would get to the store at 8am in my moon boot and be on my feet for the next ten hours, close up, go home, elevate my foot and repeat for the next six months.   
I worked that store like nothing I’d ever done before. I made sure that every customer who walked in knew my story, understood our brand value, believed in the vision we had for our product and business and left feeling like they belonged to our business. It worked and this tiny store – about 15 square metres (50 square feet) – was more profitable in its first month than our established website was that same month. We had found a magical niche in the middle of Cape Town’s tourist season on one of the most popular Cape Town shopping streets.   
This was a wildly exciting time for me. Not only was this now officially my first business selling a physical product, but it was also my first retail business, ecommerce business and first go at manufacturing a product. I was racking up the firsts, left right and down the freaking centre. What a time to be alive\! I was so pumped that I decided to embed myself in the retail industry and really give this all I had. I soon discovered that Cape Town is home to one of the most popular tourist destinations on the African continent: The V\&A Waterfront. Yes, that’s correct, a shopping mall in Cape Town is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Africa. It’s not the Sphinx. It’s not Victoria Falls. It isn’t the great wildebeest migration from Tanzania to Kenya. The number one tourist attraction in Africa is a fucking mall. And you can bet your last dollar that I was going to get into that mall and sell my socks.   
I started to call anyone I could think of who might have ties to the Waterfront. I started to talk to people about my desire to have a store there. I started to put out the word that I was hunting their executive team for meetings so that I could pitch them the hottest style company in South Africa. In no time at all I had figured out who the PA was to the CEO and contacted both the PA and the CEO. I had been in touch with the head of marketing for the mall, who put me in contact with the head of leasing, who then put me in contact with a fantastic lady called Amanda. Amanda was my target and I was going to do whatever it took to make her understand that Nic Harry was the only thing that the Waterfront was missing.   
I invited Amanda to the launch of our store in the CBD. I sent her socks for herself and her partner. I arrived at her offices with drawings of what a store and a kiosk might look like if we were allowed in. I was relentless and it eventually paid off. We opened our Waterfront store in February 2016, just a few months after opening our first store.   
I didn’t just accept anything that was sent my way. Amanda had initially offered me a kiosk at the Waterfront that I turned down. Rolf (our investor) had said to me that a friend of his has advice for opening stores: *Stores are like buses, there’s always another coming around the corner*. Basically: *Don’t rush, because the next one is coming*. I took his advice (this time) and politely declined to rush to open a kiosk a month before the Christmas rush in 2015 in the wrong location. There was no way I could find good staff. There was no way I could build the store I wanted to build on such short notice and there was no way we had enough stock to get into a store so close to the holidays. I was declining the best possible mall I could find.   
Luckily, I had built a good enough relationship with Amanda and her team and our product was sufficiently unique and extraordinary that when the next kiosk became available I was prepared to say yes and dive right in. I didn’t have to wait long. We received another offer to move into a kiosk in the mall in February 2016\. This was far enough away that we could prepare properly, build the store, hire staff and prep our stock levels. We had between November and 31st January to shift our company focus from ecommerce into Store \#2 at the Waterfront. This was a pretty big jump that I significantly underestimated.   
Fortunately for me, around this time a very large South African retail was declaring bankruptcy and retrenching staff. I was able to take my pick of very well qualified and reliable people. I found two fantastic guys from Hilton Weiner and hired them in short succession. They joined the company and received training while I was also working in the Wale Street store, running the ecommerce site and designing the new store for the Waterfront. Jen and I were working ourselves ragged but having a shitload of fun while doing it. This was a manic but fulfilling period in the business and we were firing on all cylinders.   
We opened the Waterfront kiosk on 1st February 2016 and I worked in that store for almost a month straight, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. I wanted to get a feel for the flow of traffic, how gruelling the hours were, how friendly the customers were, what the music was like, whether the air conditioner was on too high and if I could make the sales in the same way as I did in the first store. That first month blew our previous revenue targets out of the water. The Waterfront kiosk earned more money in one month than our website had earned in a quarter. We had found our cash cow. Or so we thought.   
The Waterfront and Wale Street stores continued to make significant profits for the business through the summer season, which only really ended in April in South Africa. Winters are notoriously tough for retail stores in South Africa and ours was no different. We made less profit but both stores and our website were still break even or profitable as we made our way through winter.   
Now the growth bug had bitten me. This, combined with investor confidence, led me to hunt for new stores and further investment. I found both. I managed to connect with Jon. Jon has many, many years of retail experience and put money into Nic Harry because he wanted to help us scale the physical retail side of the business which is where his skill lies. As I pushed deeper and deeper into physical retail my focus on the ecommerce side of the business began to lessen. That is not something I noticed until very late into the brick and mortar journey. I was putting all my attention into the parts of the business that were generating immediate cash flow.  
Jon joined the Nic Harry team operationally for a short period. This was not without complication as some of my board believed that Nic Harry should stabilise, learn more about physical retail and figure out how to integrate our ecommerce into the two stores we were already operating before we grew our physical presence. I believed that Jon was able to guide us through the various mall store offers and land us in the right malls at the right time.   
As Jon was joining us we were hunting for and being offered stores at many different malls across South Africa.   
Jen and the board were reluctant to continue to grow but I was certain that pushing for growth was the right move at the right time. I had my head down and I was focused on our winning strategy. I wish that I had lifted my head up just a little bit and been more in touch with industry related news. If I had been more aware of what was going on in the world I would have noticed that the retail industry was collapsing around me. As I was opening stores there was a retail crash in the USA like never before. Nearly two thousand stores would close in 2017, hundreds of malls and tens of thousands of people would lose their jobs in the retail sector that year in the USA. This is important because the SA retail market follows trends from abroad. The USA is a country that has too many malls and I didn’t know it as we continued to open stores, but South Africa is suffering from the same problem. We have too many malls in South Africa.   
It’s mid-2016 and Nic Harry has three stores running; online, Wale Street and the V\&A Waterfront in Cape Town. In an 18-month period between August 2015 and February 2017 Nic Harry would open five stores. That’s a new store every 3.6 months. For a retail company as young as Nic Harry and a retail entrepreneur as naive as I am, this was nothing short of ridiculous; nevertheless I liked my odds at the time.   
Jen and I consciously set out to test our model. We wanted to learn as much as we could in as short a time as possible. The board agreed with this in principle but, in hindsight, we all overlooked something very obvious: if you are testing everything then you don’t know which parts don’t work when they break. Here are just a few things we tried to test out in a short 18 months:  
 

* Opening our first stores in different cities (one in Pretoria, one in Johannesburg, three in Cape Town).  
* Managing retail teams across two provinces with a flat management structure.   
* Ramping up our production to cater for a fivefold increase in demand.   
* Launching new product ranges.   
* Hiring, training and promoting team members.   
* Integrating ecommerce into physical retail.   
* Stock management across six stores.   
* Figuring out which store model works: small, medium or large.

Any sane person can see from this list that we were testing too many things in too short of a time. I, however, did not realise this until bits of everything started to fall apart.   
Internally, Jen and I decided that if we couldn’t make the big stores in Pretoria (Menlyn Park Shopping Mall) and Tyger Valley profitable through Christmas 2016 and into the winter of 2017 then we would start to exit the stores as fast as possible from about May that year. Here’s how the roll-out looked: 

August 2015 – Wale Street (Cape Town)  
February 2016 – V\&A Waterfront (Cape Town)  
November 2016 – Tyger Valley Shopping Centre (Cape Town)  
November 2016 – Menlyn Park Shopping Centre (Pretoria)  
February 2017 – Rosebank Mall (Johannesburg)

Christmas 2016 came and went. The Waterfront and Wale Street stores pumped and propped up our hopes for retail. Tyger Valley barely broke even. Menlyn showed signs of hope but that mall was plagued with issues that would continue to haunt us. Overall, our store roll-out had been a flop but we continued to talk our way into staying open. Rolf pushed us to rethink the bigger stores, close them as quickly as possible and cut our losses. Jon worked to convince me that we should stay the course and push through because things were bound to pick up.   
Ultimately, I should have looked up from the daily grind to realise that the global market was tanking and ours was no different. Menlyn Park pushed us around and was absolutely horrific to work with. Olive (the MD at the time) and her minion Sisanda misled and lied to me at every opportunity, sometimes avoiding my many, many calls every day for weeks and weeks. These delays cost Nic Harry hundreds of thousands of rands in rent, stock, staff retrenchments and store fitting costs. After months of trying to be polite and following the appropriate protocols I decided that the only way for me to get any results would be to physically visit the Menlyn store as often as possible. I flew up to the store every other week for months. Every time I’d go up to see the store I would drop into the landlord’s offices and sit and wait for Sisanda or Olive or anyone who would listen. I nagged them, I bugged them, I forced them to hear me and when they wouldn’t I made my own solution for that store. I found a replacement tenant, I negotiated my own exit, I pushed through the brick wall of pain in front of me and did the deed.   
Eventually I managed to close the Menlyn Park store. I was also lucky to be able to close down the Tyger Valley store exactly 12 months after opening it. The blow to my ego and the businesses cash position was immense. I had a lot of growing up to do. I opened too many stores, did not see what was happening in the world or in South Africa and ploughed ahead with plans that put my business in jeopardy. I have had enough distance from the brutal 12 months in 2016/17 to understand that as much as my ego forced me to open these stores it was a lack of ego that helped me knuckle down, retrench staff with enough time give them a decent exit and close the stores that were sinking our chances of survival.   
Here’s the thing, you can’t see all the possible outcomes. When we opened five stores in 18 months, we thought that success depended on us alone. A huge part of these stores not working out is due to our naivety as retailers and our lack of experience in this industry. However, we also forgot to stop and look at the world and consider all of the factors that might be out of our control, like a failed Menlyn Park Mall, a tiny retail industry, misunderstanding our target audience in certain markets and a collapsing retail industry on a global scale. We didn’t consider that we could control two stores but not five and we didn’t consider that we had no clue what we were doing and were in over our heads. Hell, if any entrepreneur truly believed that then none of us would build anything because I think we’re always in over our heads but smart enough to learn the lessons. Luckily for Nic Harry, I was able to pull back, cut quick and cut deep and stave off the losses.

## **WORKING WITH YOUR LIFE PARTNER**

When I was 20 years old and at the end of the second year of my degree I met a woman who would change my life. I didn’t really know it at the time, but I knew that she was special and I needed to be around her. Jen and I studied in the same politics class for three years but I had never met her. I didn’t attend many classes in the three years that I was at university. Our politics class consisted of only about 50 people, so it just goes to show how few lectures I attended when you consider that I didn’t meet Jen until the end of our second year in the same class.  
One day I was at a friend’s residence getting lecture notes to study for our final exam and Jen was leaving the room as I was about to enter. I asked my friend who that woman was and was told that I had been using her notes for two years so should probably learn her name. It was Jen.   
That very day I told my friend that I was going to date Jen and 13 years later we’re still together. It’s a miracle that she has stayed with me this long and through so many businesses and failures. Most recently, Jen and I have worked together every day for the past four years at NicHarry.com. 

Jen is my gut-check.   
That’s a good place to start. I am a full steam ahead kinda guy. I like to do more and do it more often. I don’t like to stop and wait. Jen likes to be more considered and think things through. She likes to mull things over, wait a bit longer and see how things play out before making big decisions. My gung-ho approach to decision making and life in general is perfectly balanced out by Jen’s more considered and conservative approach to decision making. Our complementary relationship has worked extremely well for us in our personal lives and in business. Without a doubt, I would not be the person I am today without Jen in my life. Without a doubt, Nic Harry would not be the business that it is without Jen.   
Working with family is always tricky. Everyone says that you should avoid it at all costs and I believed that too for a long time. I’ve never wanted to work with my father or uncles. I’ve never wanted to do anything with my sibling, but working with Jen seemed like a complete no-brainer. But it isn’t easy to work with your life partner. There are days when I want to scream at Jen like she’s an employee. There are days when she definitely feels like I’m an asshole because I’m being an asshole. Fortunately on those days we are both very honest. We’re not mean, we’re just honest. At Nic Harry I decided that we needed to practise radical candour. This sounds a lot more complicated than it is. Radical candour simply means to care personally and challenge directly. I try to make sure that my team is honest and caring about their colleagues and their work. Kim Scott literally wrote the book on radical candour and her first revelation around the concept was when her boss at Google criticised her for saying the word ‘um’ too much in a presentation that actually went off really well in front of her senior management team. Kim didn’t really take any notice but her boss persisted and told her that she sounded stupid when every third word she said was ‘um’. Many of you reading this will be cringing because we all say ‘um’ a lot throughout our day and especially when we’re nervous doing a presentation, but Kim realised that it was the kindest thing that her boss could possibly have said. She gave a crap about how Kim sounded in front of others. She also cared enough to take the uncomfortable step and tell Kim directly. This is radical candour. When I discovered the theory I knew that I absolutely had to start implementing it in my personal life and at Nic Harry.   
It took some time and a bit of getting used to for Jen and me to realise that being honest did not mean being a dick. Sometimes it does, but on the whole when someone is honest with you it’s a show of respect and for Jen and me it meant that we could deal with our work stuff at work and not take it home. When we had issues that needed to be raised, we just raised them in a caring but honest way. Sometimes frustration gets in the way and caring disappears and all you’re left with is brutal honesty. But on the whole radical candour has opened up our relationship to a world of straight talk, care and resolution.   
One of the most difficult things for me to learn that goes hand in hand with radical candour is learning to acknowledge my shortcomings and to apologise sincerely and quickly. If you are apologising without sincerity then it’s not a valid apology, and if you do it sincerely but it takes you two weeks to do then it prolongs the pain and means much less. I’ve learned to get over myself, drop my ego and listen to Jen (most of the time) when she tells me something honestly and with care. My gut reaction used to be to defend myself; now because I trust Jen, her judgement and the intent behind the criticism, I’ve learned to first question myself and then if need be to apologise for any wrongdoing or misunderstanding.   
Our complementary relationship broke down and became blurred at Nic Harry at a critical decision making period for the business. We had just opened our Wale Street and Waterfront stores and were raising money to open three more stores. The two of us spent days and days debating the pros and cons of opening these stores in such a short period of time. Jen and I both agreed that it would be challenging but she pushed hard to dissuade me from committing to the leases and jumping in so heavily and so quickly.   
In true founder style, I did what I do best and negotiated the vision, pleaded my case for going all out and eventually I won Jen over. She knew deep down that it was a risky and dangerous decision for our business. She knew that it was a misstep but she trusted my judgement and agreed that it was an all or nothing moment for us and the business. As you have already read, diving in head first was a mistake. Jen and I both feel equally responsible for making a decision that we were so unsure about. I think that Jen takes it a lot harder than she should, but she takes her gut-check role quite seriously in our business. I’m the person who thinks big vision, big risk and big reward. Jen is the balance to my recklessness and on this occasion she felt that she had let us down. The truth is that I managed to convince my shareholders and board that this was the right decision, so no matter what had transpired between Jen and me, we were more than likely always going to open those stores and go for it. Sometimes I’m stupidly obsessive and manipulative, no matter how hard Jen is checking my gut and hers.    
An important part of working with your life partner is to separate out work and life. This is extremely difficult to do when I’m so obsessed with my work. For a few months after we started working together I would constantly discuss work. I would wake up thinking about something we should do in the day and then while making dinner continue to discuss things that happened through our work day. It became so bad that I would literally check my email while lying in bed and discuss the mails I was reading with Jen who was lying next to me trying to read her book.   
This was not sustainable and fortunately Jen said something about my obsession. After a short discussion we decided to implement no-work times for ourselves. As a rule in our house we were not allowed to discuss work before 8am in the morning and after we walked in the door after the work day. These hard and fast rules were necessary in the beginning to break the habit of me constantly discussing work with Jen. Eventually I came to realise that not only was Jen right about it being unhealthy for our relationship, but it was also slowly driving me nuts. For the two of us there needed to be a very clear separation between our work relationship and our personal one. The blurring of the lines meant that both were falling apart and neither of us enjoyed the setup. Fortunately we were both practising a level of honesty that allowed us to have a pretty simple discussion and lay out the rules. The discussion obviously can’t end after one conversation. For us it’s an ongoing evolution of how we engage and work together. It may not work out forever and that’s OK with us both. 

So if you are thinking about starting a business with your life partner here are some things that I’ve learned: 

* Be honest. Not the movie kind of honest. I mean the brutal, hurtful and harsh kind of honest. If you can’t be honest with each other, don’t start a business together.   
* Be kind.   
* Learn to apologise. This is probably the greatest lesson that Jen has taught me; it’s OK to apologise quickly and mean it and move on. You don’t need to hold a grudge.   
* Communicate. It’s so fucking cliché but it’s true. Over-communicating is better than under-communicating. The more you know, the less you are guessing about.   
* Do not be sensitive. It’s not about you. It’s almost never about you. When it’s about you, see the points above and Be Honest, Be Kind and Apologise.   
* Leave it at work. If you can’t separate your office hours and your personal time then you’re doomed to work all day and stop caring about each other aside from what you can both accomplish at work.

## **MENTORS, ADVISERS & ADVICE**

Throughout my working life I have searched for a mentor. I know people who have amazing mentors and they can’t live without these people. I have never really found a mentor in the traditional sense. I don’t know how to find a good mentor, if I’m honest, and I’m not really even sure what a mentor is in the traditional sense or is supposed to be. What I have done successfully is make friends with people who have more life experience than I have. Most of my closest friends are at least a decade older than I am and, without realising it, they have become my collective mentors and advisers. I have also managed to meet amazing entrepreneurs and bring them into my life. Many of them have very kindly provided me with advice and insight into their own experiences to help me through my own. I suppose these people are a form of mentor in my life and I have spent years watching them, studying their moves, figuring out their failures and trying not to repeat them. Because they are mostly entrepreneurs I always have a point of reference to look to when I am struggling to figure out which way is up.   
If you can’t find a mentor then look to your social circles for the guidance that a mentor might be able to provide. This takes me straight back to the earlier chapter about who you choose to be friends with. As accountants like to say: shit in, shit out – bad data in gives you bad results. In the same way, if you have crappy friends, then you’re going to get crappy advice and have really bad role models pushing you in the wrong ways.   
Recently in my career I have been extremely fortunate to earn an adviser who has given me more time than I deserved and more teachings than I could have hoped for.  
I met Zev Siegl in my sock store in Cape Town in 2015 after we both spoke at an event for Old Mutual. Zev and I missed each other at the event but fortunately I was in my store when he and his wife visited.   
You might not know who Zev is, but you will definitely know the company he founded with two other guys in Seattle in 1971: Starbucks.   
Zev and I sparked a fast friendship and he kindly offered his time to me. This was a completely random occurrence so the best advice I can give you here is to do things that challenge you and challenge your normal existence. Put yourself in a position to meet people like Zev because I can assure you these sorts of people aren’t walking around office cubicles looking for you.   
I can say with some level of certainty that many entrepreneurs would not have known who Zev was had he randomly walked into their store. Unbelievably, I had just finished reading a book about Starbucks and the story of how the company was founded and grew to be the behemoth it is today. Zev is a feature in this book and I spent a fair amount of time researching each of the three founders as well as Howard Schultz (who bought Starbucks and built it into the business it is today). The chances are tiny that I would have chosen the Starbucks book, and have read it, and been in my store when Zev walked in. I gave myself the best shot to be that lucky. Gary Player once said that the more he practised, the luckier he became. I feel the same. The more I read, the more I submerge myself in my chosen specialty, the more I would become lucky and meet the right kinds of people.   
So Zev and I chatted for a while in the store and he gave me his card and left. I waited a few days for him to return to Seattle and then emailed him asking if he would be open to a Skype call. Almost immediately he agreed and we were off. Zev and I spoke at least once a month for a couple of years and still speak frequently to this day. He is extremely knowledgeable and generous with his time and advice and I use it very carefully. I don’t call Zev just for a random chat. I make sure that I have a specific agenda to cover, I ask him clear questions and seek advice on very specific and very relevant topics that I know he has experience with.  
There was a time that I was so desperate for a mentor that I would often force relationships with people who were not ready to mentor anyone, did not know that they were mentoring me, or were just complete assholes and incompatible with me and my style.   
For a long time I believed that Vincent was a mentor to me and sometimes he did mentor-like things that helped me progress but I don’t believe that you should work with your mentors. I was once told by Rob Stokes (the founder of Quirk) that a mentor should want to invest in your business but never do so. I completely agree with this sentiment. If your mentor moves from someone who provides you with fair and objective advice to someone who is invested in the outcome of the advice in a financial way then the advice changes and the relationship dynamics are broken. The advice begins to take the form of an instruction or calculated move.   
I have found that as social media and access to news and information have grown and grown, it has been easier to get advice from many sources. You can read TechCrunch, you can read BusinessInsider or even read Mark Zuckerberg’s personal blog. There are more resources available to entrepreneurs today than ever before and for me that has meant a lot of overwhelming fear. I am fearful that other entrepreneurs have better mentors, are getting better advice, know more people, understand things better than I do and even have a leg-up on me because they might be exposed to a group of people that I will never gain access to. However the opposite of this is also true. There are so many resources available nowadays that you need to just get started. If you can’t find a suitable mentor, pick a way of educating yourself and dive in.   
After looking for a single mentor to guide my career and failing, I decided that I would read biographies about how people built things. I have read books about Ford, Nike, McDonalds, Ben & Jerry’s, Nintendo, Lego, Silkroad, Alibaba, Amazon, Versace, Twitter, Warren Buffett, Kevin Hart, Trevor Noah, Aziz Ansari, Famous Brands, Jack Welch, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Steve Martin, Pixar, Banana Republic, Polaroid, Ron Jeremy, Anthony Kiedis, Slash, Walmart, Marilyn Manson, Tina Fey and many more.   
These have been my mentors. These books have come into my life at the right time and taught me more than just about any person ever could.   
One of the people who helped me with Nic Harry for a short period of time was the founder of a fashion company in South Africa called Earth Addict. Johnny was introduced to me by a mutual friend and was extremely kind and forthcoming with his advice and insights into the fashion world. At the time that he and I first met I had just started Nic Harry and was only selling online. I think Johnny met with me to find out about ecommerce as much as I met with him to find out about traditional retail. This turned out to be a mutually beneficial knowledge-share, not a mentor/mentee relationship, and it was important for me to realise this quickly and use the sessions with Johnny appropriately.   
The meetings we had became very practical and were less philosophical and much more focused. I asked him what he does if someone steals from him in his store and he gave me fantastic advice that I still use to this day. I would ask him about stock control, hiring, firing, HR and other issues my business was facing and he would give me enough advice to be helpful. Johnny had a great impact on Nic Harry early on and I’m grateful for that. It cost him nothing but 30 minutes every few months and in return I gave him the knowledge I had acquired about ecommerce. We both benefited and both understood that this was a relationship that was temporary and had limited value. This is not a mentor, but an ally and a colleague. Useful, but not the same.  
I’ve also noticed that over the years it has been my friends who have become a kind of mentor to me and me to them. We all rally around one another when we learn something. We share knowledge and resources, we share deals and profit when we can. We drift together to do cool things and drift apart when things need to split up.   
You don’t need to find a mentor who is old and experienced and wears a suit. Mentors come in many different forms but you have to go out and find these mentors in your life. Don’t sit in your office staring at a computer and hope to find the perfect person to help you. Build your network over time and if you are honest, have integrity and continue to build amazing things over time then your network is going to show you the mentors you need, introduce you to the right people or tell you to read that great book or listen to that one podcast that might change your life. Seek knowledge everywhere and be passionately engaged. No one owes you anything and that means you have to do more to find the right mentors in your life. You’re going to fail a lot along the way. I’ve asked a lot of people to help me through the years and some people take up the mantle and help where they can, others are sharks and charlatans and are just waiting for you to fail or to slip up for their own profit, and you’re going to have to learn from those experiences.

## **BUSINESS PLANS ARE FOR MBAs**

I have only ever put together two formal business plans in my life. Business plans are very much like a high school certificate. Everyone has to have one but once you have it, no one asks you for it.   
The only people I have ever seen write a business plan before building a business are MBA students doing projects to acquire their MBAs  
I’m sure there are many businesses that started from a business plan, but honestly I have never personally seen it done like that. I’ve never done it that way. OK, that’s actually a bit of a lie. I tried to do it that way early on in my entrepreneurial career.   
I had a plan to build a web development company called Wired Works. I had a website running called SA Rocks, I also had my personal blog and a partner who could code. We were definitely going to be a dev company, surely\! So instead of going out and getting clients, I did the grown-up thing and put a business plan together. By the end of the many weeks that it took me to write everything down, Wired Works had a 56-page business plan but no business. It was literally 56 pages of actual paper. We had 56 pages of babbling, but we had no traction and no income. Naively we believed that because we wanted to raise money, we needed a business plan and at the time the most popular way to build a business was to raise funding from someone else and then figure out your business later.   
It’s pretty obvious now to see how we were thinking: Silicon Valley businesses are raising money for just about anything, this is how people build businesses. No one will take us seriously without a business plan, let’s put a business plan together and worry about the actual business later.   
The sad truth is that this is what the corporate world believes and what business traditionalists want you to believe too. You can’t build something without a plan for where you are going and how you are going to get there.   
Wired Works was sitting with a 56-page business plan, no real business and two keen founders who want to build stuff. I did the only thing that I could do with such a corporate business plan, I took it to a corporate finance friend of mine. Patrick was extremely polite and helpful but, thinking about this now, I cringe because I can just imagine what he was really thinking: This kid has no clue about business. But Patrick was fantastic and helped me understand that businesses are not built on business plans. They are built in the actual building of them. Ideas need to be turned into reality and the entrepreneur needs to shoulder the risk at the very start. You can’t expect a person or institution to part with their money and invest in your business if you’re not willing to put in the hard hours first.   
Let me be clear here, the hard hours are not spent writing a business plan. At least not for me. It’s easy to sit down and write a business plan with an end goal in mind and a path to get there. That’s called storytelling. Anyone can tell a story and make it look nice and feel good. In a story, everyone can get rich quick and with very little difficulty. Actually building something is more like being Frodo Baggins in *The Lord of the Rings*: you are destined to suffer. The thing you love the most is probably the thing that is going to end up killing you and most of your friends are not going to be able to help you get to the top of the fiery mountain when the rocks keep falling around you and destroying your progress.   
As expected, Wired Works did not receive funding. We did not build a business and we did not take any risk. We tried to roll a few businesses into a single business plan and trick someone into giving us money with a good story. That’s not how you build anything of value. That’s not how you grow something that matters. That’s how you try to find the path of least resistance and cheat the process. Of course there are businesses that do this. They raise millions of dollars in funding off a business plan, a phenomenal story and a terrible prototype. These types of businesses often explode in a ball of paper that once resembled their important business plan.   
A fantastic example of this is Juicero, a company that produced a $700 Wi-Fi-enabled juicing machine, raised $120 million in funding and collapsed when it was discovered that you didn’t need the $700 machine to squeeze the juice from their overpriced juice packs. You could just squeeze the juice out by hand. There is no business plan in the world that can prepare you for this kind of business ending publicity. All the big media guns got in on the action as the *New York Times*, *The Atlantic*, Bloomberg, Esquire and many more published scathing review after scathing review. The founder was publicly shamed and the business did not recover. Investors lost all of their money and that was that.   
At Motribe Vincent and I became quite frustrated when we were first trying to raise money. We were frustrated because we had to stop building our company and write a business plan. A business plan was something that was in our way. It was holding us back from actually solving the problem we had discovered. Traction, platform, users and growth were our focus. Writing a business plan was something we had to formalise so that our potential investors (who liked our growth) could formally review our business and decide if they wanted to give us money. When we first went out to raise funding all we had was a one-page document that we took to our investors the first time we met. It explained our prototype, traction and growth plan. We then unlocked a phone, showed them the live version of the site and nailed it down. Further down the line they required the business plan but once it had been written we rarely looked at it again. In a fast moving and ever changing industry business plans can be a hindrance, not an effective guide.

## **FIND A MENTAL COACH**

Asking for help is something that most entrepreneurs that I know struggle with. We think that we should have all the answers and be able to help ourselves out of our own problems. I have no idea why this is the case. I think it has a lot to do with ego and proving to the world that we’ve got this. It’s stupid. For a bunch of intelligent people, entrepreneurs can be morons sometimes.   
My mental health is one of the things that I have neglected for years. I do not struggle with any diagnosable disorders. I am not bipolar, depressed or an addict. What I mean when I talk about mental health is more closely aligned to physical health. Exercise is important and for years making sure you are physically fit has been a priority for many people. However, mental health has been completely ignored as a legitimate focus for many people. I found myself in the same position and only after more than a decade of building businesses did I decide that I could not make myself mentally fit alone. I needed a coach. That’s how I like to think about my psychologist; he’s my mental coach. It’s perfectly normal for athletes to have coaches that help them to refine their running style, the way they strike a ball or drive a car but, for whatever strange reason, it is not commonly accepted that high-impact entrepreneurs require a coach to help them stay mentally fit and agile.   
Let me be the first person to tell you that it is perfectly acceptable to seek out a coach to help you organise the boxes in your brain so that you can unpack them as and when you need. Stop seeing psychology or mental health as a weakness. You are not weak for wanting someone to augment your mind and help you become a better version of yourself. I can’t think of a single professional athlete who never received a single day of coaching to become a pro. Start thinking about yourself as a professional athlete and then it becomes extremely sensible to have a coach to guide you through tough times and make your good times even better. 

The first time I saw my psychologist I spent 40 minutes interviewing him. I needed to find out if he was the guy who could help me. I had a warehouse in my brain full of information, emotions and experiences but all the boxes were piled in the middle of the warehouse in no particular order. It was chaos, and not the good kind of chaos theory that Amazon uses to organise their insanely big warehouses. I needed help organising the boxes because I couldn’t find anything that I was looking for and it was driving me nuts, literally.  
The first person who insisted that I see a professional to help me with my mental warehouse was a great friend of mine, Justin. We were sitting in a warm pub hiding from the freezing cold in Austria on a snowboarding trip and I had just been ousted from my Motribe. He had also just been through some things and was shocked to hear that I was going through such an emotional period of my life without a professional to talk to and help me along the way. He swore by it and made me promise that I would go and see someone. I promised but did not seek help.   
A few months later another friend of mine told me that he was also seeing a psychologist and it was the best thing he’d ever done. I began reading about top business people and their use of mental coaches, psychologists and life coaches to get through very specific issues they were facing. Eventually I broke and started to seek out a coach for my mental state. Before this period in my life I had refused to see a psychologist because when I was a child I had once seen a psychologist about insomnia and she was a fucking charlatan.   
I just couldn’t get to sleep. I would go days and days working off an hour of sleep here and there. Eventually my parents became extremely concerned and took me to see a child psychologist. This lady sat me down and within five minutes of my being there she had decided (against my insistence) that I was being bullied and that’s why I was not sleeping. I was not being bullied. A few months earlier my father was hijacked in our home and I had watched it happen. I have never spoken about this next part openly but what I did next is the reason that I was unable to sleep. I made my brother lock my father outside. I had gone to the kitchen to unlock the gate for him and when I peeked around the corner I saw the three men with guns running towards my father. They made him kneel down and at that point I decided that we needed to lock him out of the house. We needed to close and lock the door so that the hijackers didn’t come inside. That moment infiltrated my mind and turned my sleep into nightmares. What kind of a person locks out their father when he’s being hijacked? Growing up, I understood that I wasn’t locking him out, I was protecting myself and the family inside the house from the bad men with guns outside the house. But what I needed was for a psychologist to understand this, find this piece of information, uncover it and then explain it to me in a rational way. What this terrible woman did was ignorantly label me a victim of bullying.   
It took me almost 20 years to overcome my anger towards psychologists and find one who actually helped me. August was the perfect fit for me. He takes bullshit from no one, deals with people like me every day and knew exactly how to manage my issues. I sat with him for five sessions and then I was done and he was happy to see me go. That’s when I knew that he was the right guy for me. He knew that I needed him to unpack specific boxes, organise the rest in my mind, and equip me with the right tools to find the boxes in the future. He was honest, harsh and didn’t pull any punches in giving me his opinion. There was nothing cryptic in his tactics and I appreciated that. If you are building something that is putting you under immense pressure, you owe it to yourself and the people around you to seek out a coach to guide you and help you through things. Don’t think you are above it, you are not. The greatest minds in the world have a support system. Go out and build your support system. You’ll be grateful that there are other people in the world who understand you and can help you through your most difficult times.

## **BE CURIOUS**

I remember the exact moment I became an atheist. This is also the moment that I remember truly questioning a fundamental belief in my life. My parents have always had a difficult and complicated relationship with religion. Culturally, my family is of Greek Orthodox religious descent. You can be Greek (cultural heritage) and not be Greek Orthodox (religious heritage) but it’s uncommon. At the very least you are Greek and Christian. I don’t know many Greek atheists personally. I’m sure they exist but I don’t know them\!  
My dad really tried to make me religious. I mean that as I’ve said it. He wanted to turn me into a religious person. He didn’t really guide me towards it so much as thrust me into a church. Being thrust into a Greek Orthodox Church is creepy when you’re a curious kid. I remember being about eight years old and walking into the entrance of the church and my mother told me to lean forward and kiss the printed image of Mary and Jesus. She meant it literally and I gave her a look of confused disgust. I did not want to lean forward and place my eight-year-old lips onto the same spot that literally hundreds of other people had placed their dirty lips that same day. I was horrified but forced into it. I immediately questioned the reason for the kiss. I was kissing printed paper. It was strange.   
The ceremony back then was conducted in ancient Greek. I questioned this too. If they wanted me to learn to love this religion or even just understand it, surely the ideal language would be the one that most of the people spoke? I would learn later that afternoon at lunch that my grandmother (a devout Greek Orthodox follower) does not speak ancient Greek and followed along in her modern Greek Bible.   
The third and final thing that I questioned that day that would forever cement my lifelong desire to question everything was the communion. Communion is the act of receiving a blessing from the priest. In the Greek Orthodox Church at the time, the way to receive communion was as follows. The entire community present lines up in single file in front of the priest who is holding a chalice filled with sherry (to this day, strange memories rush back whenever I drink Old Brown Sherry) and little pieces of bread. The priest dips his ancient spoon into the cherry bread mixture and summons the first person towards the spoon. You lean in and open your mouth so that the priest can thrust the sherry bread in for you to consume. You then close your mouth, swallow, do the sign of the cross (move your hand up towards your head, down to your crotch, up towards your right shoulder and across your chest to your left shoulder), turn around and walk away. The priest wipes the spoon and then summons the next person to repeat the mouth-thrusting-cherry-bread procedure. I saw this and flipped. I started to pull at my mom’s jacket and point to the horror show in front of me. Why? Why would they subject us to such cruel and unusual punishment? The germs\! OH\! THE GERMS\! But again, I was trapped, I was eight years old and I was sandwiched between my mother and my father and had nowhere to go. So my mom said that she would go first to get all the bad germs from the other people and I would then go after her to feel as if it’s just her in front of me passing on germs. Not as bad, but still unbelievably gross to my young mind.   
I left that church and vowed never, ever, ever, EVER to do anything just because that’s how it has always been done. I truly believe that this single day in church was one that changed the course of my life. I may not be religious but I have to thank the church for enlightening me\!

My friend and ex-business partner Courtenay (Thus Far, Digspot, StudentWire) moved to Australia and after he had been there for a while we began talking about how badly he wanted to start a business. He would go back and forth, week after week and month after month thinking about what he wanted to do, how he could start his own thing and what it should be.  
We would have Skype sessions where he would ask me how I came up with my ideas and after a few months of this I became a bit frustrated and responded with what I now call my Empty Room Theory.  
I asked him where he was while he was trying to come up with these ideas and he responded that he was sitting in a room in his house.  
I told him to get up and go outside and do more stuff. You don’t come up with ideas while sitting on your couch at home. That shower moment you’re waiting for ... it doesn’t exist. That ‘AHA’, ‘EUREKA’ breakthrough that you are hunting, it only exists in the movies. Ideas come from experiencing the world, from living and from finding interesting problems to solve. You cannot sit in an empty room with no windows, staring at a blank wall and expect to discover anything or build anything.   
You are programmed to experience and enjoy the world through repetition and routine. You wake up in mostly the same way every day. You brush your teeth in the same way almost every day. You sit on the toilet and do pretty much the same thing every morning (or evening if you’re an evening kinda person). These habits become part of the background of our experience of the world. We very rarely remember waking up every single day and what we did because each day is very much the same. The days you remember, the ones that count, the ones that really matter, are the days where you are forced out of your comfort zone. These are the days and the moments that can really jolt you out of your mundane routine and into a new way of thinking. Routine is fantastic to keep you sane, alive and going through your day to day, but an entire day of routine can quickly become an entire life of routine lived without much to really make you stop and think about your life.  
Throughout my life I have made deliberate choices to not take the easy route. I question everything. I mean that quite literally. Every little thing that can be questioned, is questioned and it can definitely become infuriating for the people around me. Just imagine:  
‘Why is pasta made this way?’  
‘I wonder who invented this particular chair and why they chose to have it this way.’  
‘Wow, that word you just used is incredible, but I think you used it incorrectly, let’s Google that.’  
My curiosity only became more evident with Google in my pocket. Now whenever I knew someone was wrong I could point it out. I became impossible to sit with or talk to. But this is the curiosity that makes being an entrepreneur manageable.  
Being curious 24/7 means that I am constantly learning and constantly curious about everything that I engage with. This applies to my businesses too. The Empty Room Theory is precisely this way of thinking. Exposure to things other than what you are used to in your routine will provoke new ways of thinking, living and being. Go out and do more and the chances of discovering your next big idea are infinitely more likely. 

One of the core beliefs that I live by is that sometimes you have to blow everything up and start over, as you learned in the chapter about my consulting company, Forefront Africa. This can be extremely traumatic for people who don’t think the way that I do. Most people like a routine and need normalcy. In battle, soldiers look to their leaders to lead, to tell them what to do, who to kill and when to do it. They don’t like to think about the why. They don’t like to question orders because once you open Pandora’s box, you’re fucked. There is no going back. On the whole, people do not like to question the status quo.   
You’re reading this thinking: that’s not true. But it is. The people of Zimbabwe were prisoners in their own country because a vicious dictator kept a firm grip on the ability of people to question his leadership and enact change. People stay unhappily married every single day because they can’t imagine a world where they decide that divorce is acceptable. People believe in thousands of gods across the globe believing that theirs is the true god. Why? Because they were born into the religion and it’s all they’ve ever known. If you stop and really question your experience of the world you will quickly begin to pull at a thread that unravels your entire system of belief and existence. Most people don’t want to do that. The entrepreneurs that I know don’t know how to stop doing that. They just want to do more.

## **DOGS AND DISTRACTIONS**

Everyone works hard. Even if you don’t think that Rick in the admin department at your company works as hard as you do, I bet he thinks he works hard. I think it’s a human condition that we all believe we’re working hard. Over the past few decades it has become a badge of honour to work long and hard and ruthlessly focus on your business at the expense of everything else. I blame Steve Jobs and the godlike status he has earned over time. He gave up everything, his health, his family and even a daughter to build Apple. That’s not something to aspire to for everyone.   
Believe it or not, there are people who actually manage to build really great businesses without that level of sacrifice. Don’t get me wrong, there’s always going to be sacrifice but it doesn’t have to be all the time and it doesn’t have to be to the Jobs extreme.

While building Motribe and experiencing severe stress, depression and anxiety, Jen and I decided to get a dog. I have no clue what made us do this insane thing but we believed that we wanted to have something to take care of and have around the house and office with us. Getting a dog is by no means a small task. It’s not something to be underestimated. I definitely underestimated the owning of an animal.   
We settled on a Shar Pei (the ones with all the wrinkles on the birthday cards) and named him Mumford. Mumford quickly became the focus of all of my spare attention – which wasn’t much at this point. He’d sit on my lap while I was working in front of the TV. He’d wake us up in the middle of the night because he missed us (we had to train him to be independent) and he forced us out of the house at least once a day to walk him.   
Living in Cape Town means you do not get a house with a garden big enough for a dog to get exercise. We lived near the promenade so Jen and I tried to walk him every day after work. It shouldn’t have been such a difficult thing to do, right? Walk a dog once a day between 5pm and 6pm. Sadly, for me it was. I would get home from Motribe and immediately get on the phone to investors or clients or Vincent and while Jen was getting Mumford ready for the walk I would hush her to keep quiet while I was on the phone. Then I’d stay on the phone as we walked out the door, as we crossed the road, as we walked along the incredible Sea Point promenade with the amazing views and sensational sunsets. I’d do this day in and day out.   
At this point in my life, the only thing that really mattered was making Motribe work. Sure, now I understand that a 40-minute break to walk my dogs without thinking about work is beneficial in so many ways. But back then, every minute mattered and everyone and everything that took me away from my work was the enemy, dogs included.   
Then a few months into having Mumford around we started to go to dog training at a park on Wednesday afternoons. That meant that I had to leave work slightly early and take him on alternate Wednesdays. I hated it because it dragged me away from my focus. Shar Peis are difficult dogs to train because they are quite stubborn and our trainer had no clue how to manage a difficult dog (and owner). So I’d go, I’d shout at my poor little puppy. I’d pull at his collar and move his backside around to the appropriate ‘heel’ position when he wouldn’t heel. It was horrible. Looking at it now, I can’t believe how misguided I was. But this is what we’re told to believe as founders: choose your startup or your life, you can’t have both. What a load of horseshit.   
In our fifth year at Nic Harry things were tough. We were in the middle of one of the worst retail collapses in recent history. Thousands of stores closing all around the world and we had just opened three new stores in a very short period of time. I was up against it, stressed, losing money, hair and sanity. But at Nic Harry I had learned that life does not come second to anything. We now have two dogs and every day, twice a day, we walk Mango and Mumford. It doesn’t matter what’s happening at work at the time. When lunch time hits, we stop and take the dogs for a midday walk and then between 5pm and 7pm we stop work and take time out to walk them again. They probably don’t need that much exercise but here’s the thing: I do. I’m obsessed with work, with what I do and how to improve and excel all the time. But I’ve learned that sometimes the best solutions are found outside. Sometimes being calm helps to weather the storm. Sometimes the magic you’re looking for is outside of work and deep inside distraction.   
I’m fortunate that I’ve realised that distractions, hobbies, dogs, kids or whatever it is you choose, are actually a necessary addition to your business. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of people who choose to make these things negative distractions because the work they are doing is the most important work in the world and no one understands. If you are one of those people then let me tell you that your work is not more important than mine, your partner’s work, your kids, your dogs or your own mental health. Walking my dogs every day contributes to my mental health improving all the time.   
Go out and find your own happy distractions. It’s not something I suggest you do, it’s something that I firmly believe will improve your work and your life. It’s not natural or sane to work 12 hours a day, watch four hours of TV and then sleep for eight hours and repeat that cycle until you die. Mix it up a bit\!

## **PICK YOUR PEOPLE**

Finding a good business partner is more difficult than finding an honest politician. I have had many business partners, as you know by now, and I have developed a simple rule: *Trust people until they give you a reason not to.*  
Then make damn sure that when you start a business with someone all of the rules are laid out upfront. The equity you will each retain in the business, the salaries you will each earn, who does what in the business, and everything in between. You might think that I am being paranoid but, trust me, you should plan for the divorce, not the marriage. Getting into business is as easy as a handshake but getting out of a business can be more costly and painful than an actual divorce.    
No matter how uncomfortable it may be, whatever you do, set out the rules of engagement in a written document and get that document signed by all parties involved. Once that’s all out of the way you can move on to the fun stuff and forget about the contracts until you need them in the distant future. In my experience, the moment you require that signed document to decide how to proceed with your partnership is the moment that partnership is dead in the water.   
Through skilled curation of the kinds of people in my life, I have been able to shape and mould my experience of the world. I have worked hard to identify people who drain my energy and to remove them from my life. Almost immediately I notice that I have more energy and can focus on the things that I love and want to do more of. If I add someone into my life who complements my abilities and helps me to be a better version of myself, it will dramatically accelerate my life and move me towards my goals.  
I struggle with people who see themselves as victims of the life they were born into. People who believe that they have to have the friends they have, or the parents, brothers, sisters, teachers, mentors, business partners or life partners. It blows my mind that we are willing to blindly accept into our lives the people who influence who we become.   
Everyone makes a choice about what food to eat today for lunch or whether to turn right or left on the route to work. But most people don’t consider that they have the ability to choose the people that they include in their lives.   
Throughout my life I have been skilled at cutting people out. I don’t cope well with people who affect me adversely and take from me without giving. I do not suffer fools or frauds.   
Before you continue reading this chapter, I’d like you to take a few moments to think about the five people you spend the most time with. Are they good people? Do they make you better? Are they nice? Do they make you feel good or bad? Do you feel energised after you’ve seen them or tired and drained? Think about it honestly and then read on.  
My dad used to say to me: ‘Show me your friends and I’ll tell you who you are.’ Sure, he wasn’t the first person to say this but it always stuck with me.  
What I would come to realise later in life is that when my dad asked me to show him my friends, he was trying to tell me to keep the right company. Sure, when I was a kid he was likely asking me to literally point out my friends to him in the crowd so he could assess them and decide if they looked dodgy or not. The difficult part is figuring out what the right company looks like to you, not your dad.

Here’s an example of keeping the right company to illustrate my dad’s strange way with words: 

Elon Musk built PayPal with Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman (amongst others). The PayPal founders would go on to become known as the PayPal Mafia. Collectively, they founded businesses such as Tesla Motors, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, YouTube, Yelp, and Yammer.    
Musk now runs Tesla and SpaceX and is also heavily involved in Solar City and the Boring Company. Subsequent to PayPal, Peter Thiel founded Palantir Technologies which is valued at over $20 billion. Thiel was also the first investor in Facebook and a close adviser to Mark Zuckerberg. Reid Hoffman went on to found LinkedIn which recently sold to Microsoft for $26 billion dollars. 

Do the five people closest to you have the potential to change your life in significant ways? It doesn’t have to be about business, but I can assure you that if you have a life partner who doesn’t believe in your new idea for a business then the chances of your taking the leap to build it are slim to none. The people closest to you define your world and affect it in dramatic ways.   
The right company, in my opinion, helps you to become a better person. They are not satisfied with your mediocrity and they want the best for you. They add to your life and don’t subtract from it. They want the best for you and that doesn’t come with the caveat that being happy for you depends on whether they are happy.  
If you are thinking about the people in your life and you don’t like what you feel about them or yourself when you’re with them then maybe it’s time to reconsider whether they fit you any more. Read these next words carefully: You are not obligated to have these people in your life. You get to choose who you spend your time with. If you don’t like your boss, find a new boss. If you take abuse from your siblings or your friends, then find new ones. You only have a finite number of days to be around people, and you are infinitely better off spending those days with people who are good for you.  
Surrounding yourself with the right people isn’t about being an entrepreneur or a business person. It’s not about a career or a smart move. It’s about living the kind of life you want. I’m sure that no one wants to live a life where their friends mock them constantly. Fuck those guys. Move on.  
Throughout my life I have been fortunate enough to have met a host of unique, interesting, successful, evil, unkind, kind, brilliant, humble and arrogant people. Sure, I’ve met boring people too but I can’t remember them. They were insipid (I believe this is one of the worst insults you can direct at anyone – calling them insipid).  
I have learned throughout my time as an entrepreneur that relationships are like businesses to me. I can nurture them, research and grow new ways to engage with them, expand my friendships and include other partnerships into the ones I already have. Or I can neglect them and watch them whittle away and die. Both of those scenarios are perfectly acceptable.   
For some strange reason we mostly believe that you should keep friends forever. The world of social media and Facebook are trying to make us believe more and more that we must stay connected to people for longer or forever. I do not believe this is healthy. I am not the same person I was 15 years ago. I don’t want all of the same friends that I had 15 years ago and they probably don’t want me either, but we are forced to stay friends in this odd moral obligation that puts more strain on us than anything else. That’s not how friendships should work. Personal relationships should be allowed to fail, just like businesses.   
Without doubt, it is the people in my businesses and my life, not the businesses themselves, who have mattered the most to any kind of success. A great idea with terrible people behind it will fail. An average idea with the best people will more than likely succeed. People matter most, so do yourself a favour and find the best people to build things with. This applies to your job, your business, your sports teams and your personal life. Find the best people and then trust them until they give you a reason not to.

# **Epilogue**

## **DO. FAIL. LEARN. REPEAT.**

Throughout this book I’ve told you about how I do, how I fail, how I learn and how I have repeated (almost to the level of insanity) these steps to build my businesses and my life. What follows is a short summary of the model that I choose to live by. If you like the premise, give it a try but remember to repeat and expect failure. 

**1\. Do.**   
Don’t just sit back and watch life go by. Do something about it. Do something with it. Do something epic. Do something amazing. Do something small. Do it today. Do it right now. Get up and *do more*. 

**2\. Fail.**   
You are absolutely going to fail. You’re going to fuck up. You’re going to be lost. You’re going to be confused. You’re going to be hopeless and sad. You are going to lose your money. You’re going to lose other people’s money. You’re going to be a bad friend, father, brother, sister, aunt, mother, uncle. You are going to fail. Read it and believe it. You cannot avoid failure, it’s coming for you. All you need to do is reframe your failure. You are not failing, you are figuring out all the ways that don’t work. 

**3\. Learn.**  
When you start doing more you will definitely start failing more. Failing more means suffering more. If you are suffering and not paying attention to the lessons being presented to you, then you are in for a never-ending world of pain. If you are beating your head against a wall in a business right now and you can’t find your way out of the darkness then you probably aren’t paying attention to the lessons you have learned in the past. This is partly why I’ve written this book; I needed to write down the lessons I’ve learned so I don’t forget them and hopefully others can suffer slightly less because I suffered and learned. 

**4\. Repeat.**  
Some people will do. A few will do more. All of those people will absolutely fail at some point. Some will learn the lessons that failure provides and some will not. Almost no one will get up and repeat the experience. Most people quit after one go. Most people stop when it gets hard. Most people go back to the life they had before they became an entrepreneur because they liked the cushy salary. For the few of us who end up repeating the process so that we can yet again do more, fail, learn and repeat – I tip my hat. This shit is hard but there’s only one process in my life that keeps me feeling alive:   
DO. FAIL. LEARN. REPEAT.
