## TL;DR

We are socialized to fear failure. Schools teach us that failure is an end point — game over. But in business, failure is a through point, not an end point. The only difference between data and disaster is how your organization deals with failure afterward. Teams that implement blameless postmortems, run small experiments, and treat failure as information rather than identity build resilience, learn faster, and ultimately produce the innovation that blame-centric organizations never will.

I spent the first decade of my life building businesses and failing. Literally from the age of 16 to 26, I was one big fat entrepreneurial failure. Hell, I even wrote a bestselling book about it.

In my life, living has meant doing. I've always done things very proactively. I've always aspired to do more and more things. I can't imagine a life without doing. That means that a lot of my time has been spent failing. When you start out doing something, you generally aren't very good at it. Most people drift towards something they can do with some level of competence, become good enough to be paid for it, then stop trying to do anything new or different. They stop doing more. They stop trying to get better. And therefore stop failing.

I've never really had it in me to stop trying to get better and stop learning. Failure is an integral part of that.

As a [virtual keynote speaker](/speaker) who has built and failed at more businesses than most people attempt, I'm going to make the case that your organization's relationship with failure is the single biggest predictor of whether it will innovate or stagnate.

## Failure Is Not Fatal — And If It Is, You're Doing It Wrong

Let me say this clearly: failure is not fatal. If failure is fatal, you're doing it wrong. Perhaps think about doing something else.

Failure is not an end point. Failure is a through point. It is not something to be feared but something to teach us what didn't work, what could work, what almost works, and what we can do better. Failure is something your teams should not avoid but should work toward — in small increments that don't break the back of your organization, but act as calculated lessons that are a good use of budget.

I've never met a successful entrepreneur who is afraid of failure. Avoiding failure is not a viable or smart business strategy. Your organization needs to figure out how to embrace failure, mitigate the impact of failure, and integrate the lessons learned through failure into its core DNA. You cannot avoid failure on the path to success. That's like asking your child to walk without learning how to crawl. The one thing leads to the other.

## The Difference Between Failing and Feeling Like a Failure

There's a critical distinction that most people miss. There is a difference between failing and *feeling* like a failure. And I think that learning is that difference.

When you learn through a failure, you have not failed. You've learned how not to do something. You've learned a new way to not solve the problem you are working on. There are many versions of the famous Thomas Edison quote about inventing the light bulb. I like this one the most: "I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work."

It's easy to fail and then slump into a depression and forget that there is a lesson in there somewhere. It's easy to fail — trust me, I've done it a lot. In fact, it's probably the thing I am most successful at. What happens with most people is that they fail and then feel like a failure. And feeling like a failure is what makes people want to stop doing and stop learning.

If no one has said this to you before, let me be the first: you are not a failure because your business failed. Businesses fail all the time. Denying your struggle will only make it worse.

## 5,127 Prototypes and 14 Years of Trying

If you want to see what a healthy relationship with failure looks like at scale, look at James Dyson. He famously built 5,127 prototypes of the Dyson vacuum cleaner before discovering the single way to build a vacuum cleaner without a bag.

Let me repeat that. 5,127 prototypes.

Be honest when I ask you this: when was the last time you gave up on something difficult after one try?

It took Dyson 14 years to create the final version he was happy with. That means there was no innovation for 14 years. There was only [curiosity](/topics/curiosity), a bias towards action, and an obsessive focus — with lots and lots of failure. And then, after 5,127 prototypes and 14 years of trying, there was an innovation.

This system of learning by doing isn't random. It was a philosophy pioneered by John Dewey — the foundational idea that people don't learn by passively memorizing information. They learn by doing, by experiencing, by engaging. Doers learn faster. And they fail more. Those two things are inseparable.

## Why Your Organization Creates Fear of Failure

We are socialized to be fearful of failure. We are taught at school that if we don't pass, if we don't do amazingly, we won't go to university. We don't get the job we want. We live a less meaningful life. Failure is seen as an end point. As game over.

But this is fundamentally flawed and an outdated way of thinking about the world in business. In a world where everything is moving so quickly, you need to try. And I believe that you have only truly failed if you have not bothered to try.

Here's the thing: our organizations create environments where people are afraid to try. So we need to start undoing that work.

Think about the typical failure cycle in a corporate environment. Through a series of changes in direction, bad planning, or poor decision-making, an organization becomes desperate. They slash resources, slash deadlines, try to force performance. And because that doesn't work, they implement more process, more meetings, more alignment — more work around the work instead of the real work. And then when things go belly up, they implement a culture of blame.

What do you think happens to the person who leaves a blame-centric meeting? They feel unsafe. They run off and tell their work best friend exactly what's going on — and that if anything goes bad, somebody's head needs to roll. A culture of decay sets in. This is not a psychologically safe space. And teams that are not psychologically safe will never experiment, never push boundaries, and never produce anything that resembles innovation.

## Blameless Postmortems: Shifting From "Who" to "What"

So how do you start undoing this? One powerful practice you can implement right now is what Etsy calls a **blameless postmortem**.

After an incident or a massive failure of any kind, they have a structured debrief. They bring together the people involved. And here, "blameless" means no fear-based blame. Attendees are empowered to tell people what they did, what their assumptions were, what they witnessed, and what they wanted to do instead — without the fear of punishment.

This shifts the narrative in those meetings from "who messed up and how do we fire them" to "what system, context, or process did we implement that we should change."

That single shift — from *who* to *what* — transforms how an organization processes failure. It turns an ending into a beginning. It turns blame into learning. It turns fear into curiosity.

Sharing failure is an imperative for any organization trying to rapidly retool for the AI era. [Entrepreneurial teams](/topics/entrepreneurship) need to quickly understand their colleagues' mistakes, failures, data, and lessons — and learn from them.

Studies have shown that firefighters who debriefed on case studies of errors made by more experienced colleagues were better equipped to handle new problems than those who only studied successes. A failure shared is a failure halved.

## Post-Traumatic Growth: Why Failure Makes Teams Stronger

There's a psychological concept that I believe every business leader needs to understand: **post-traumatic growth**. It is the positive psychological change experienced as a result of adversity and other challenges, in order to rise to a higher level of functioning.

In short, most people who experience a trauma — upwards of 85 percent of them — report becoming improved versions of themselves once they overcome that trauma.

I see failure as a trauma. Firing people is a trauma. Shifting directions as a business is a trauma. Doing hard things is traumatic. But we should move toward those traumas because post-traumatic growth implies that your business will be a better version of itself once it's done something difficult. Once it's experienced something traumatic.

Avoiding these traumas takes you longer to push forward. Takes you longer to grow. Striving for failure, experimenting in small batches, and obsessing over big problems is the way for your business to get better quicker.

If you reframe failure as an opportunity for you and your business to grow, you will start to thrive in situations that present a failure. Understand that failure is trauma, but your psychology and that of your team and business will evolve for the better after a failure. If you avoid failure, you will never improve. If you never experience failure, you will never grow.

## Small Experiments: Lowering the Stakes

Many organizations and people are afraid of failure because the stakes are too high. We give ourselves one shot to make it or everything blows up. The key to embracing learning is to lower the stakes.

One big experiment more often than not leads to one big failure.

Reframe experiments as small opportunities to learn about your business and your customer. Take smaller risks more often, record the results, and then iterate with your next experiment. Help your team become comfortable with the concept of small, manageable experiments and they'll start to experiment on their own and bring you results to review.

Google's AdSense was a project that emerged out of their 20% time and is now one of their biggest revenue spinners. Atlassian pioneered the idea of a hackathon as a short and more affordable way to invoke their team's curiosity. Corporate hackathons are now everywhere — from LinkedIn to Facebook to Microsoft.

One company that understands this at a fundamental level is 3M. One of their team members in the 1920s was a young guy named Richard Gurley Drew. His job was to go around and give samples of sandpaper to clients. Time and time again, Richard would go into these workshops and see painters struggling with two-tone paint jobs. They would put something across the top to protect the bottom paint, but it would fall off and damage the paint job — or the sticky thing would rip the paint off once it was done.

Richard realized he had the resources in front of him to experiment and find a solution. He asked if he could do this. And two years of experimenting later, Richard had taken the gum used on the sandpaper and experimented with it enough that he had come up with what we now know as Scotch tape — or masking tape.

This completely changed how 3M sees their business and engages with their team. This kind of progress is only there when your people are not afraid to fail and they're given the freedom to experiment.

## The Innovation Flywheel: Failure Feeds Curiosity

With great curiosity comes great failure. And with great failure comes great curiosity. Failure promotes curiosity, and curiosity promotes action, which inevitably produces more failure — and more learning.

This is the [innovation flywheel](/topics/innovation) in action. If you've taken some action and experienced a failure or success, go back and analyze the data. Be more curious. Explore the information and take new action, which will lead you to new information through another failure or success. The system feeds itself — but only if failure is safe.

Remember: innovation is an outcome, not an action. There is no innovation for 14 years while you're building 5,127 prototypes. There is only curiosity, action, and obsessive focus with lots of failure. And *then* there is an innovation.

Your job is to make the failures small enough that they don't break the back of your organization. Our job is to make failure a through point, not an end point. There is no success without failure along the way.

## My Reframing: Do, Fail, Learn, Repeat

This simple reframing of failure has changed my life forever. It wasn't something that happened overnight. I've had to suffer many setbacks and learn many hard lessons to understand that there's no way to go forward and build something amazing without making mistakes along the way.

I do, then I fail, then I learn. The more I do, the more I learn. Sure, that comes with a significant amount of failure, but what's a little pain to achieve a little gain?

Starting a business has not made me a happy person. Many would argue it has done the opposite. But starting a business has made me feel more alive than anything I've ever done. I don't know how to live another kind of life anymore.

These are not only lessons for entrepreneurs. These are lessons for anyone who wants to rethink and reframe the way they exist in the world and live their lives. Right now you might be building something without even realizing it. A career. A reputation. A family. A skill set. A team. If so, then you might need to shake things up, rethink, and reframe the way you are building.

There is very little that you can mess up that ends your life. If you aren't dying, you aren't really failing. You're just adding to your list of learnings. Every time you fail, you're just figuring out how your life works.

## FAQ: Failure, Postmortems, and Organizational Resilience

**What does "failure is data, not destiny" mean?**
It means that failure is information, not identity. When something goes wrong, the question isn't "who failed?" but "what did we learn?" The only difference between data and disaster is how your organization responds to failure. Teams that extract lessons from failure build resilience. Teams that assign blame build fear.

**What is a blameless postmortem?**
A blameless postmortem is a structured debrief held after a failure or incident where attendees share what happened, what their assumptions were, and what they observed — without fear of punishment. The focus shifts from "who messed up" to "what system or process should we change." Etsy popularized this practice and it's now standard in high-performing engineering and product teams.

**How do you make failure safe in an organization?**
Three things: (1) run small experiments more often — lower the stakes so failure isn't catastrophic, (2) implement blameless postmortems so people aren't punished for honest mistakes, and (3) publicly share lessons from failures so the whole organization benefits. A failure shared is a failure halved.

**What is post-traumatic growth?**
Post-traumatic growth is the positive psychological change experienced as a result of adversity. Research shows that upwards of 85% of people who experience a trauma report becoming improved versions of themselves. Applied to business, this means that teams and organizations grow stronger through difficult experiences — if they process those experiences properly rather than suppressing them.

**How does failure relate to innovation?**
Innovation is an outcome that only appears at the end of a long process of curiosity, experimentation, and failure. James Dyson built 5,127 prototypes over 14 years before producing a single innovation. There is no shortcut. The organizations that fail the fastest and learn the most will innovate before their competitors.
