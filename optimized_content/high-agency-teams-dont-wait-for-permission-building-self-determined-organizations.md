## TL;DR

Your teams don't need more AI tools or A-players. They need permission. Self-determination is a right that we've turned into an executive-offered privilege. High agency is not something you're born with — it's a muscle you can grow. But even high-potential individuals lose their agency in a system that punishes initiative and drowns them in friction. The answer isn't hiring better people. It's putting the right people in the right place, giving them permission to act, and building systems that reward initiative over approval.

I've spent more than two decades building businesses and [entrepreneurial teams](/speaker) that can think and act for themselves — teams that self-determine their path forward and solve big, scary problems to change an organization from the inside out.

And I can tell you now: AI tools and A-players mean nothing without the appropriate culture to support innovative thinking, innovative experiments, and innovative businesses.

The future of business is not innovation. It's empowering teams to be more entrepreneurial, to be self-determined, and to explore. Traditional hierarchical business structures are dead. Businesses that rely on management to tell workers what to do and how to do it are dead. Organizations pushing AI tools as silver bullets to keep old systems in place are dead. They just don't know it yet.

## What Is High Agency — And How Do You Recognize It?

Agency is the ability to act without waiting for permission. But how would you even recognize high agency when you see it?

The author George Mack has popularized the concept, and he likes to pose one question. You wake up in a developing-world prison. You're only allowed to call one person — someone you know is going to get you out of that prison. Who are you going to call?

Why did you choose this person? What is it about them that made you pick up the phone? This person has something. They've got a spark. That something is high agency.

Now think about this: who's calling *you*? Are you a high agency person? Who on your team is getting a phone call? And who's just ticking boxes?

## Agency Is Not a Finite Resource

Some of you might be thinking: "That's not fair. Some people were just born with high agency. Some people are given more permission than others. Life's just easier for some people."

I call that completely unfounded. And I want to point out that it's also low agency thinking.

Agency is not a finite resource. You're not born with it. Our societies, our schools, our organizations, businesses, and religions — they all set out to limit our agency in different ways. High agency is a muscle that you can grow. It's a skill that you can level up. It's a power-up that you can activate.

### How to Activate the Power-Up

**Locus of control.** In 1954, Julian Rotter coined the term to describe how people interpret events. You have an internal locus of control — "I influence what happens to me" — or an external locus of control — "things happen to me." Agency starts as a belief. If you believe you can change outcomes, you will. If you believe your actions matter, they do. If you believe your experiments will make a difference, you will experiment.

**Self-efficacy.** Albert Bandura showed that confidence in your ability to achieve a goal boosts your motivation and follow-through. Said another way: you don't act because you are confident. You are confident because you act. You then succeed and the loop builds itself.

**Systems over goals.** James Clear's central point in Atomic Habits applies perfectly to agency: you don't rise to the level of your goals — you fall to the level of your systems. People's behavior is shaped more by their environment than the willpower they possess. Even high-potential, high agency individuals lose their agency in a system that punishes initiative and drowns them out in friction.

## You Already Have High Agency — You're Just Not Using It at Work

Here's the thing. Just because you have low agency at work doesn't mean you are a low agency person. Take a look at your own life right now. Where do you practice high agency already?

You're not entirely passive. You don't walk through life doing nothing. You choose, you act, you decide, you maneuver. You have passions and hobbies that you actively engage in. You have what I call **selective agency**.

I've been playing guitar since I was 12. That is nearly 30 years. And as much as I wish I looked like a rock star, I don't. But I still choose to act with agency every time I sit down and practice. You choose where to use your agency. And I guarantee you — you choose to use your agency where it is rewarded.

And I know from experience that agency is not rewarded in most workplace environments. Even if you want it to be, it's just not.

## The High Agency Work Spectrum

To help you figure out where you sit, here's my high agency work spectrum:

**Quadrant 1:** You're in a rocking team surrounded by A-players, and things are moving even if you aren't moving them. Work is happening to you, but you are not happening to work. You're coasting on momentum.

**Quadrant 2:** You feel stuck with nothing to show for yourself, surrounded by B-players. Work isn't happening to you and you are not happening to work. This is the worst place to be.

**Quadrant 3:** You're the best person in your division, but the division is slowing down, suffering, and in decline. You are happening to work, but work isn't happening to you. Not great, but at least your effort shows.

**Quadrant 4:** You attract the best projects and the best people. You are all firing on all cylinders. You are happening to work and work is happening to you. This is where [high agency teams](/topics/agency) live.

Where do you honestly sit?

## Action Produces Information

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, famously said that action produces information. I couldn't agree more. The more you act, the more information you have to react to and be curious about. The converse is also true: no action means no information means no curiosity.

Think about it. If we assume that to reach the end state of innovation, you need to actually do something — well, how do you know what to do? Act and find out. How do you know what your customers want? Act and see what they say. Or better yet — act and ask them.

This is why the concept of a bias towards action is so imperative to building entrepreneurial teams. Without action, there is no information. And without information, there's nothing to learn, nothing to build, and nothing to be curious about. You're stuck.

A diary study in 2019 showed that on days employees took more initiative on their own — by anticipating and solving problems they could foresee — they were happier and more engaged at work. Looking ahead, preempting, and being proactive gave them purpose. Encouraging agency isn't just good for output. It fulfills employees' needs for meaning and engagement, which in turn reduces staff turnover and even burnout.

### A Bias Towards Action Is Not a Bias Against Planning

I want to push a word of caution here. A bias towards action is not a bias against planning. Planning is imperative. But the map is not the terrain.

You might want to get to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam when you're on holiday. But when you get out into the world after looking at the map, you don't see taxis. You don't see Ubers. You see bicycles, and none of them are yours. You take a turn to the right and instead of a car, you see an empty road. And when you eventually get to the museum, instead of an empty door, you see hundreds of people standing in your way.

The map is not the terrain. But remember — tools don't make people smart. You might have a map, but you need to walk the path.

And to be clear: even if you have a map, even if you know the terrain, your action is not asking AI to do the work. That is unfulfilling. Remember the MIT research — 83% of ChatGPT users couldn't quote from an essay they wrote minutes earlier. You have to do the thinking. You have to walk the path.

## The Wrong Way to Build an Entrepreneurial Team

Before we discuss the right way, let's name the blatantly obvious wrong way that I have witnessed and experienced in many businesses.

Through bad planning, board pressure, or just terrible decision-making, an organization becomes desperate for talent. So they start to hire quickly — which means they're probably going to hire badly. And because you're trying to get profitable, you're also trying to hire cheaply. And then because you don't really trust these people, you don't tell them their guardrails. You don't set clear goals. You don't communicate clear outcomes. You've never defined success metrics.

Then because things feel wobbly, you slash their resources. Slash their deadlines. Bring everything forward and try to force them to perform. And because that doesn't work, you implement more process. More meetings. More alignment meetings. More work around the work instead of the real work.

Then because things are flailing, you change goals. You change the outcomes that you never communicated in the first place. And you don't communicate any of this change to anybody effectively. And then when things go belly up, you implement a culture of blame. You make them jump through hoops of approval. A culture of fear sets in.

You might not recognize all of these. But even one of these problems can become an infection in the best teams. A culture of decay lets mediocre management thrive and push even more mediocrity. Every meeting that replaces action is a tax on progress. And attacks on progress are attacks on innovation.

## The Right Way: Right People, Right Place, Permission

I'm willing to bet my beard that an average team with permission to be entrepreneurial and self-determined will outperform a top team that is bogged down by process, politics, and policy.

**Talent is gated by permission.**

Most experts will tell you to hire A-players. And if you're building from scratch with endless pots of money and equity, that's great advice. But if you have an existing business, this is terrible advice. What happens to your profit centers if you have to fire everybody and rebuild?

I'm not too concerned with how many A or C players you have in your organization. You don't need A-players to build entrepreneurial teams. What's important is making sure that the right people are working on the right problems to match their skill level and enthusiasm.

Just like Mario and Scorpion. Mario is going to be absolutely decimated if he sticks around and tries to fight in Scorpion Land. While Scorpion might win in Mario Land, but the land itself won't survive. The right people in the wrong place will probably fail. The wrong people in the right place could be catastrophic.

You want self-deterministic teams. You want entrepreneurial teams pushing the boats out into the sea of new and unknown, using AI tools, experimenting and learning, while feeding those lessons back into your organization so it can grow faster.

## What $1.7 Million Per Person Looks Like

To illustrate what's possible, meet the team at Gamma — an AI company that helps you build presentations and other things faster. Each person on the team generates $1.7 million in revenue per year. They're a team of only 28 people making $50 million a year.

Right at the outset, they hired T-shaped people and built an entrepreneurial team where the thinkers are the doers. A T-shaped person is a generalist with a deep area of expertise but a wide set of skills. Think about the product manager who can also code, likes marketing, and understands design. Or the engineer who understands narrative, can sell, and can also help with customer service.

This is the ideal. It's nice to admire, but really tough to build. Which is exactly why giving people permission matters more than finding perfect people.

## Elon Musk's One-Question Innovation Test

Love him or hate him, Elon Musk believes innovation can be learned by asking one question: **Did you try it?**

Did you try to create something new? Did you try to solve this problem? Did you try to uncover the reason this exists? Did you try to talk to that colleague you don't like? Did you try something?

If you want to build a culture and internal structures that reward action — start here. Give people their agency through small wins. Help your team by creating structures that reward initiative. Remember that action is only a failure when it prevents you from trying again.

## The Innovation Flywheel: Curiosity, Action, Information

These traits — [curiosity](/topics/curiosity), a bias towards action, and resilience through failure — form what I call the innovation flywheel. It's an active system that turns your teams from passive workers into entrepreneurial teams that are self-determined.

If you have a thesis you're curious about, plan some action, get some information, and see how the flywheel kicks off. That action leads to more information — either a failure or a success. And that failure or success leads to more curiosity. And more curiosity leads to new action. The system feeds itself.

You don't need to do everything at once. Just pick one of these and get started next week:

1. **Give people permission to be curious.** Stop prescribing what they should be curious about.
2. **Reward action over approval.** Celebrate people who try, not people who wait.
3. **Treat failure as data, not destiny.** Make it safe to experiment.

## A Story of Agency: Nkosana Makate and "Please Call Me"

If you want to see what happens when one person with high agency acts on a simple idea, meet Nkosana Makate. He was a junior accountant at Vodafone South Africa who had an insight one day: millions of mobile users in South Africa, particularly in low-income communities, often didn't have airtime to make calls. Yet they still needed to communicate.

Makate had a simple idea — leverage a free message from a person without airtime to somebody else, called a "Please Call Me." He didn't go to the product team. He went to his superior in the accounting department. He then collaborated with internal teams. The feature was rolled out with a short code that allowed users to send a "Please Call Me" message at no cost, with an advert attached to monetize it — making free messages profitable.

"Please Call Me" became one of the most widely used mobile features in the country. And after a decade-long legal battle, Makate won compensation for his work.

That's high agency. A junior accountant who didn't wait for permission, didn't wait for the product team, didn't wait for a mandate from the CEO. He saw a problem, he acted, and he changed an industry.

## FAQ: High Agency and Entrepreneurial Teams

**What is high agency?**
High agency is the ability to act without waiting for permission. High agency people decide what work they do, own the outcomes, and find practical solutions forward. It's not a personality trait you're born with — it's a muscle you can grow through practice and by operating in environments that reward initiative.

**How do I know if my team has low agency?**
If your team members wait to be told what to do, avoid making decisions without approval, sit silently in meetings when they should speak up, or default to asking AI to do their thinking — those are signs of low agency. Often, the problem is the system, not the people.

**What is the difference between high agency and recklessness?**
A bias towards action is not a bias against planning. Planning is imperative. High agency people still plan — but they don't confuse planning with doing. They act on imperfect information because they know that action produces information, and waiting for perfect conditions produces nothing.

**Can you build high agency in an existing team?**
Yes. Start by putting the right people on the right problems. Give them clear guardrails but not scripts. Reward initiative, not just outcomes. Implement blameless postmortems so failure doesn't trigger fear. And make "did you try it?" the default question in every standup.

**Why does agency matter more than talent?**
Because talent is gated by permission. An average team with permission to be entrepreneurial and self-determined will outperform a top team bogged down by process, politics, and policy. The team at Gamma — 28 people generating $50M in annual revenue — proves that the right structure matters more than headcount.

## Key Takeaways

- Self-determination is a right we've turned into an executive-offered privilege. Give it back to your teams.
- High agency is not innate — it's a muscle. Your systems either build it or destroy it.
- You already have selective agency. You use it where it's rewarded. The question is whether your workplace rewards it.
- Action produces information. No action means no information means no curiosity. You're stuck.
- The right people in the right place, with permission, will outperform A-players trapped in bureaucracy.
- A bias towards action is not recklessness — planning still matters. But the map is not the terrain. You have to walk the path.
- Start with one question: did you try it?
