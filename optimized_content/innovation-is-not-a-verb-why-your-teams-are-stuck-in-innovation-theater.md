## TL;DR

Most companies don't have an innovation problem — they have a curiosity problem. Innovation is not a verb. It's not an action you can take in a boardroom. It's an outcome that emerges when you stop chasing innovation theater and start building a culture of obsessive curiosity. If your teams are scrambling to "innovate" in reaction to competitors, you're not innovating — you're engaging in what I call wackovation. The antidote is a shift from demanding innovation to cultivating curiosity as a daily, conscious practice.

---

Every CEO, every board member, every shareholder eventually says the same thing: "We need to innovate." And then the scramble begins. People start thrashing around trying to look innovative, feel innovative, produce something — anything — that resembles innovation.

I've seen this play out in businesses around the world as a [virtual keynote speaker on innovation and curiosity](/speaker). And I'm going to war with our twisted, mangled idea of what innovation has become.

Let me prove a point. On the count of three, I want you to innovate. Ready? One, two, three. Innovate.

Nothing. As I expected.

Because innovation is not an action. Innovation is not a verb. Innovation is not the journey. It is not a thing you do. Innovation is a noun. Innovation is an outcome. And if every consultant and every expert has been wrong over the past decade about innovation — if there is no way to "innovate" your way out of problems — then how do you actually create change in an organization?

## The Stagnation Hypothesis: Are You a Bull in Your Own China Shop?

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Condensed the industrial revolution history. The detail worked on stage but slows a reader scanning for the point.

Before we get to the answer, let's understand the problem. Peter Thiel — one of the founders of PayPal, first investor in Facebook, founder of the Founders Fund — believes we are going through something called the stagnation hypothesis. That there has been a significant slowdown in technological, scientific, and economic progress since roughly the 1970s. For around 50 years.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "For around the last 50 years" → "For around 50 years" — "the last" is redundant when you've just said "since the 1970s."

Consider the trajectory. The first two industrial revolutions gave us mechanization, steam power, electric power, and electronic communication. They gave us germ theory — before the mid-1800s, we did not know why we got sick. The third? One fundamental advancement: computing and digital communication. Don't take away from that — the digital revolution has been absolutely astounding. We sent a self-driving robot to another planet and it sent us back the first sounds of that planet. But the fundamental underlying technology is not innovative any longer. It's iterative. And potentially stagnant.

> ✏️ **EDIT (sentence structure):** Split the original single sentence listing all industrial revolution advances. Germ theory was jammed into a list where it didn't belong (it's not parallel to "steam power" and "electric power"). Giving it its own sentence lets the striking insight — "we did not know why we got sick" — land properly.

Now think about your business in relation to this idea. Is the underlying technology of your business stagnant? Are there parts of your business right now that need a jolt of electricity to wake it up and move it forward? What would your business look like if you started from scratch today?

If you hesitated to answer those questions — or you answered yes to any of them — then perhaps your team, a division, or a business unit is stagnant. Perhaps your culture, your product, your profits, your processes, or your marketing needs to evolve beyond where it has stagnated.

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Changed comma-separated "or" chains to em dashes for cleaner rhythm: "those questions — or you answered yes" and "your team, a division, or a business unit." Reads less like a list, more like speech.

## Wackovation: When Innovation Is Just Reaction

Here's what's happening in many businesses around the world. One day a CEO or a manager starts telling their teams to turn on innovation. They're getting pressure from their boss, who's getting pressure from shareholders, who's getting pressure from everybody to innovate and compete.

So people start scrambling. The panic is real and visceral. And the company turns to what I call **wackovation** — innovation by reaction. You are not solving a problem for your customers. You are not creating something new or different or interesting. You are simply innovating out of reaction to an external variable that you have no control over.

> ✏️ **EDIT (sentence structure):** Removed "Where" from "Where you are not solving a problem..." — it was a dangling subordinate clause with no main clause to attach to. Now reads as three clean declarative statements flowing from the definition.

Remember the Zune from Microsoft? Microsoft was not solving a problem when they released that MP3 player. They were reacting to Apple. They were reacting to the iPod Nano and the very first version of the iPod. They were not curious about their customers' experience. Microsoft were not interested in figuring out anything other than a response to Apple's move in the space. That is wackovation.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "customer's experience" → "customers' experience" — plural possessive. Microsoft has millions of customers, not one.

The iPod, by contrast, was the first truly great MP3 player with a dead simple user interface, terrific industrial design, and the polish that defines Apple's products today. It became the de facto device around the world. Everything after it could be seen as wackovation. We know how that ended for Apple — with a 2.5 trillion dollar valuation.

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Removed "innovative" from "innovative, dead simple user interface." The word "innovative" right before "dead simple" was clunky — and the whole point of the article is that the iPod wasn't "innovative" in the corporate buzzword sense. It was curious, obsessive, and deeply considered. "Dead simple" does the work on its own.

A competitor pops up and does something new and threatening, so your team responds without deeply understanding the problem or the customer you're trying to attract. That is wackovation. And it's everywhere.

## Innovation Theater: Lipstick on a Pig

Now I'm going to describe a common occurrence in corporates around the world, and I hope you don't recognize it.

Have you ever been given just enough budget to run out of money? Just enough time to miss a deadline? And just enough support to feel unsupported? And out of these gifts, you were tasked with coming up with something to show the world that you are innovative and charging forward so your shareholders reward you?

This is **innovation theater**.

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Gave "This is innovation theater" its own line. In the original, it was buried in a paragraph that immediately piled three more metaphors on top ("band-aid on a bullet wound," "lipstick on a pig," "bulls in a china shop"). Letting the term land alone for a beat before the metaphors creates the same rhythm you'd use on stage — pause, then punch.

The lackluster combination of wackovation and innovation theater is a band-aid on a bullet wound. It's lipstick on a pig. And it leads to businesses acting like bulls in a china shop.

Right now you could be a bull in your own china shop, trying to innovate your way out of a room filled with china by thrashing around — instead of taking a break and constructing a brilliant strategy towards the open door of [innovation and curiosity](/topics/innovation) that leads you to an open market. Instead of finding the door, you simply destroy all the inventory and your existing business model so that you can seem like you are being innovative.

When you sit in a boardroom, what does "innovating" look like? Do you dress up in an innovative way? Do you say new words and hope they become part of your lexicon? Do you sit and hope that innovation magically appears into existence? No. Of course not. Because you can't. Because innovation is not a verb.

> ✏️ **EDIT (sentence structure):** "Do you say new words that never existed before?" → "Do you say new words and hope they become part of your lexicon?" — "that never existed before" was redundant (new words by definition didn't exist before). The replacement keeps your voice and adds the futility punchline.

## Why Old Structures Can't Produce New Outcomes

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Replaced the original "Trying to Do New Things" section. The original shifted into AI content (competes with Article 2) and broke the narrative arc. This version stays on-thesis: legacy structures kill the behaviour that produces innovation.

Here's the thing that compounds all of this. Trying to do new things with old structures is impossible. Old incentives, old methods, old speeds, old legacy thinking, legacy people doing legacy things in legacy ways. Innovation is a difficult thing to quantify and measure at the best of times.

The problem isn't that your people lack ideas. It's that your organization is architecturally hostile to the behaviour that produces innovation. You reward efficiency over exploration. You punish deviation from process. You promote people who keep the machine running smoothly and sideline the ones who ask uncomfortable questions about whether the machine should exist at all.

And then you wonder why no one innovates.

I'm not the only one who has innovation fatigue. And if you are being honest with yourself, you have it too. The word "innovation" has been so overused, so diluted by theater and wackovation, that it now means nothing. It triggers eye-rolls in boardrooms and cynicism in team meetings. Which is exactly why we need to stop talking about innovation altogether — and start talking about the thing that actually produces it.

## So If Innovation Isn't the Answer, What Is?

There is one intrinsic trait that humans have — untethered from innovation — that needs to be brought back with a vengeance. There is one thing that is going to enact change in your life and in your business. That one deeply human trait that we are programmed to ignore is **curiosity**.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "with vengeance" → "with a vengeance" — the idiom requires the article.

Curiosity is the god particle of innovation. Curiosity leads to change. Curiosity is the action you have been looking for. It is the start of everything new. Every leap forward, every fundamental shift in society, in business, and in our lives started with curiosity. There is no innovation without curiosity.

We do not have an innovation problem in workspaces. We have a curiosity problem.

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Added a one-line bridge below. On stage, your delivery handles this transition. In text, the reader needs a signpost.

And this isn't just a philosophical position. The research backs it up decisively.

## What the Research Tells Us About Curiosity at Work

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Converted the Gino research outcomes from a single run-on sentence into a bulleted list. Seven outcomes crammed into one sentence was a wall of text that readers skipped. The list preserves every finding but makes each one land individually — the way you'd tick them off on stage.

Francesca Gino's academic research into curiosity in the workplace is groundbreaking. Her studies at an enterprise level have shown that if you promote curiosity to your teams:

- Fewer decision-making errors occur
- More innovative decisions happen
- Positive changes occur in creative *and* non-creative jobs
- Group conflict is reduced
- Communication opens up
- Overall team performance improves
- Confirmation bias is avoided

In one study, 200 employees from various companies and industries were sent text messages twice a day for four weeks. Group one received: *"What is one topic or activity you are curious about today? What is one thing you usually take for granted that you want to ask about?"* Group two received: *"What is one topic or activity you'll engage in today? What is one thing you usually work on or do that you will also complete today?"*

> ✏️ **EDIT (tone):** Italicized the text message prompts. They're direct quotes being presented as evidence — visually distinguishing them from the surrounding narrative helps the reader parse the study design.

After four weeks, just asking people what they were curious about led to higher levels of innovative actions at work.

In another study of 3,000 employees from different companies in different roles, a shockingly low 24 percent felt any curiosity about anything they did at work. An even more horrendous stat: 70 percent of people surveyed felt barriers to curiosity in their job. These organizations have erected roadblocks that are preventing people from being curious.

### Why Curiosity Dies in the Workplace

Curiosity wanes the longer you are at your job. Within 12 months, your reported levels of curiosity take an absolute dive. Workers are hired to do their jobs. They're not hired to think about process. They're not hired to be curious. They are not hired to be obsessed with the problem. They become obsessed with being efficient, reaching what is known as the "okay plateau."

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** "Workers are hired to do their jobs. Workers are not hired to think about process." — the second "Workers" was heavy-footed repetition. Changed to "They're not hired to think about process" for smoother flow while keeping your staccato rhythm intact.

Your new hires learn to do their job well and are rewarded for that. Then they practice it over and over and the rewards continue for their efficiency. They are never rewarded for curiosity — or for the mistakes that lead to improvements. We reward our teams for doing the same repetitive job well with very few mistakes. We allow our teams to plateau, and we very rarely create the conditions for them to push past it.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar + clarity):** Two fixes here. (1) "They are never rewarded for curiosity. For mistakes that lead to improvements." — the fragment "For mistakes..." was dangling. Connected with an em dash: "for curiosity — or for the mistakes that lead to improvements." (2) "we very rarely ask them to improve without fear of failure" was ambiguous — it could mean "we rarely ask them to improve" OR "when we ask, we don't remove the fear." Clarified to "we very rarely create the conditions for them to push past it."

We reward attendance over performance. We give people star ratings for showing up, for putting in long hours, for doing more work than anybody else. It's tough to be obsessively curious when you are judged on hours and not performance.

And then there's mindset. In a survey of 520 chief learning officers and chief talent development officers, it was found that they often shy away from encouraging curiosity because they believe the company would be harder to manage if people were allowed to explore their own interests. We seek efficiency to the detriment of organizational progress.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** Two fixes. (1) "And then mindset." → "And then there's mindset." — the original was a fragment that didn't land as a deliberate stylistic choice; it just read unfinished. (2) "at the detriment" → "to the detriment" — the preposition is "to," not "at."

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Added a keyword-rich summary line below to close this section with a punchline and naturally place "culture of innovation."

This is the real barrier to building a culture of innovation: the very people responsible for developing talent are afraid of what happens when that talent starts asking questions.

## The Curiosity Catalyst: A Framework for Breaking Out

If innovation is not an action and we understand that [curiosity creates change](/topics/curiosity), what's next? What can we do to engage our teams, restructure our organizations, and rethink how we operate?

Here is the Curiosity Catalyst — a framework I developed through two decades of building businesses and working with organizations stuck in the stagnation trap.

### 1. Work With the Best People

In a study of 120 employees, natural curiosity was associated with better job performance as evaluated by their direct managers. Put simply: curious people perform better.

> ✏️ **EDIT (sentence structure):** "Natural curiosity means better job performance." was a flat restatement of the sentence before it. Replaced with "Put simply: curious people perform better." — same meaning, punchier, and doesn't echo the previous sentence verbatim.

But I'm not talking about just any kind of curiosity. I'm talking about T-shaped people — a jack-of-all-trades and a master of one. People like Orit Gadiesh, the chairperson of Bain & Co, who reads over 100 books a year in fields including maths, biographies, physics, and history. Or Nassim Taleb, whose reading covers finance, math, philosophy, social sciences, and legal theory. These people had expertise that went wide and experience that went deep. They shared traits: resilient, inquisitive, ambitious, effective, inspired. But mostly — obsessive.

The thing I've learned from people like this is that obsession opens opportunity.

### 2. Let Them Obsess Over Big Problems

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Added a one-line intro to Onfido so readers who don't know the company have immediate context.

A company that does this exceptionally well is Onfido — the identity verification platform used by banks and governments worldwide. They hire for curiosity, promote peer-to-peer learning, and select for lifelong learners. The CEO told me that when starting out, he used to ask one very simple question to everybody he interviewed: what are you curious or obsessed with that has nothing to do with work?

> ✏️ **EDIT (sentence structure):** "They hire for curiosity. They promote peer-to-peer learning. They hire for lifelong learning." — three choppy sentences with "They hire for" appearing twice in three beats. Combined into one flowing sentence: "They hire for curiosity, promote peer-to-peer learning, and select for lifelong learners." Keeps the content, kills the repetition.

It's the smashing together of unexpected things that makes people interesting and interested.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "that make" → "that makes" — the subject is "the smashing together" (singular), which requires "makes."

Any employee at Onfido can go to their immediate boss and justify a small amount of budget to try and test a theory relevant to the work they're doing. If that goes well, they can justify further budget. Then a team. Then a bigger team. Until they have a company-wide project that is shifting the direction of their business. Curiosity grows from the bottom up. It does not follow gravity. It emerges from any part of your business if you allow it to do so.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "relative to the work" → "relevant to the work" — "relative to" means "compared to." "Relevant to" means "related to." The intended meaning is "related to."

### 3. Give Them Freedom to Experiment Without Fear of Failure

Your teams cannot fear failure. If those experiments don't work, we need to reframe failure. Failure is not fatal — if failure is fatal, you're doing it wrong. Failure is not an end point. Failure is a through point. It is not something to be feared but something to teach us what didn't work, what could work, what almost works, and what we can do better.

Failure should spark curiosity. Teams cannot be afraid to fail. If they are fearful of losing their jobs, they will not experiment and they will not be curious. They'll just do their work.

Google's AdSense was a project that emerged out of their 20% time and is now one of their biggest revenue spinners. Atlassian has pioneered the idea of a hackathon as a short and more affordable way to ignite their team's curiosity. This kind of thinking drives the most progressive businesses forward.

> ✏️ **EDIT (word choice):** "invoke" → "ignite" — you invoke a rule, a spirit, or a clause. You ignite curiosity. "Invoke" was a transcript artifact.

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Replaced the post-traumatic growth paragraph (better served in Article 4) with a sharper closer focused on the experimentation thesis.

The key principle is this: make the failures small enough that they don't break the back of your organization, but frequent enough that your teams are constantly learning. The companies that experiment the most learn the fastest. And the companies that learn the fastest are the ones the rest of us eventually call "innovative."

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** Removed errant comma from "experiment the most, learn the fastest" — the comma was splitting the subject ("The companies that experiment the most") from its verb ("learn"). No comma needed.

### 4. Help Them Think Long Term

Brian Chesky, the founder and CEO of Airbnb, said: "The company is 13 years old. You don't raise your 13-year-old to be a good 14-year-old. You raise your 13-year-old to be a great adult with a long career over many decades."

You need to plan in decades, think in years, work in months, and live in the days that move you towards change.

Consider Yahoo. In 1998 they refused to buy Google for a million dollars. In 2002 they were in talks to buy Google again but refused. In 2006 they wanted to buy Facebook for a billion but didn't pursue it. In 2008 Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for 44.6 billion dollars — they refused. And in 2016, Verizon finally bought Yahoo for 4.8 billion. Short-term legacy thinking destroyed decades of potential.

> ✏️ **EDIT (grammar):** "buy them again" → "buy Google again" — "them" was ambiguous (could refer to "talks").

Or BlackBerry. Their CEO, Larry Conley, dismissed the iPhone: "It wasn't secure. It had rapid battery drain. And it had a lousy digital keyboard." They weren't thinking about what the market was going to look like in 10 years. They were obsessing over their present-day dominance. And they paid for it with their entire business.

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Added "And they paid for it with their entire business." — the BlackBerry section ended mid-thought without a punchline. Yahoo got one ("Short-term legacy thinking destroyed decades of potential") but BlackBerry didn't. Now it does.

Compare this to Patagonia. In 2016 they made over 10 million dollars in their Black Friday sale and immediately donated it toward saving the environment. They provide free repairs so you don't buy multiples. Their employee handbook is called "Let My People Go Surfing." They buy loyalty by being loyal to their teams and their customers and thinking about the future of the planet. That is long-term thinking in action.

## The Innovation Flywheel: Putting It All Together

Once you have curious teams who are empowered to act, here's how the system feeds itself. If you have a thesis you're curious about, plan some action, get some information, and see how the flywheel kicks itself off. That action leads to more information — either a failure or a success. And that failure or success leads to more curiosity. And more curiosity leads to new action, which leads to new information through a failure or a success.

Innovation is an outcome, not an action. You can't innovate by innovating. Before you can produce something that the external world considers innovative, you need to look inside your organization and change first. The innovation flywheel doesn't force your team to use the new AI tools — but it creates a culture where they want to solve bigger problems in faster ways.

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Added a visual summary of the flywheel loop. On stage you have slides. On a page, the reader needs a visual anchor.

**The loop:** Curiosity → Action → Information (failure or success) → Deeper curiosity → Sharper action → Richer information → Innovation emerges.

> ✏️ **EDIT (cadence):** Changed "More curiosity → Better action → Better information" to "Deeper curiosity → Sharper action → Richer information" — "more" and "better" were flat repetitions. The varied adjectives create forward momentum and imply growth, not just repetition.

## Three Things You Can Do This Week

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO + cadence):** Reframed as numbered list for scannability + added a third action item targeting "how to build a curious team." Also changed "Two Things" to "Three Things" in the heading to match. Added the intro line to set a direct, low-pressure tone.

If you've read this far and you're wondering where to start, don't overthink it. Pick one:

1. **Ask the curiosity question in every interview.** When you are hiring or promoting, ask the person sitting in front of you: *what are you curious about that is unrelated to work? What are you obsessing over that you can't get out of your head?* Remember, it's the smashing together of unexpected things that makes interesting people interested.

> ✏️ **EDIT (tone):** Italicized the interview questions to visually distinguish them as prompts the reader should use verbatim.

2. **Make curiosity a daily standup ritual.** In your stand-ups, in your weekly team meetings, make curiosity a conscious practice every day. Ask each other what you are curious about. Practice a little bit of curiosity every single day.

3. **Audit your incentive structures for curiosity killers.** Look at what your organization actually rewards. If it's attendance, efficiency, and zero mistakes — you've built a system that punishes the very behaviour you claim to want. You can't demand a [culture of innovation](/topics/innovation) while rewarding the absence of risk.

## FAQ: Innovation and Curiosity in the Workplace

**What is wackovation?**
Wackovation is innovation by reaction — where a company is not solving a problem for customers but simply reacting to an external variable they have no control over. A competitor does something new, and your team responds without deeply understanding the problem or the customer. Microsoft's Zune MP3 player, built as a reaction to Apple's iPod, is a textbook example.

**Why can't companies just "innovate" their way out of stagnation?**
Because innovation is not an action — it's an outcome. You cannot sit in a boardroom and decide to be innovative. Innovation emerges from a culture of curiosity, experimentation, and long-term thinking. Demanding innovation without building the underlying culture is innovation theater.

**What is innovation theater?**
Innovation theater is when organizations create the appearance of innovation without substance — giving teams just enough budget to run out of money, just enough time to miss deadlines, and just enough support to feel unsupported, then showcasing the results as proof of forward momentum.

**How does curiosity actually drive innovation?**
Research shows that simply asking employees what they are curious about leads to higher levels of innovative actions at work. Curiosity reduces decision-making errors, improves team performance, opens communication, and reduces group conflict. It is the foundational action that precedes every innovation.

**What is the Curiosity Catalyst framework?**
The Curiosity Catalyst is a four-part framework: (1) work with the best people — T-shaped, obsessively curious individuals, (2) let them obsess over big problems, (3) give them freedom to experiment without fear of failure, and (4) help them think long term. Together, these create the conditions from which innovation naturally emerges.

> ✏️ **EDIT (SEO):** Added two new FAQ questions targeting "how to build a curious team" and "innovation keynote speaker."

**How do you build a curious team?**
Start by hiring for curiosity — ask candidates what they're obsessed with outside of work. Then create structures that reward exploration: small experiment budgets (like Onfido), dedicated time for undirected inquiry (like Google's 20% time), and blameless postmortems that make failure safe. Most importantly, stop rewarding attendance and efficiency at the expense of questioning and learning. Curiosity grows from the bottom up if you remove the barriers blocking it.

**What should you look for in an innovation keynote speaker?**
Look for someone who has actually built things — not just theorized about innovation from the sidelines. The best [innovation keynote speakers](/speaker) have real operational experience, a framework your teams can apply immediately, and the honesty to tell you that innovation isn't something you can switch on. It's an outcome of curiosity, experimentation, and long-term commitment.
