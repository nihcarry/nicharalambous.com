<p>When I was about five or four years old, my mother recalls a story of me being called Nikki, a diminutive version of my name, Nick or Nicholas. At the age of four, announcing to my mother and my family that I’d had enough and I no longer wanted to be called Nikki. I wanted to be called Nic. This was instigated by me. I think this is the youngest memory of my agency being harnessed to change the way the world saw me or the way that I saw the world.</p><p>The second example I can think of from when I was a young child is being about seven years old and being forced to go to a Greek Orthodox church with my family on a Sunday morning. As you walk into the Greek Orthodox church, you are presented with the image of Jesus and the image of Mary, and you are made to kiss them both with your lips onto the image behind the congregation and then make your cross. At the age of seven, I just outright refused because it was gross and hygienic! Kissing after so many other hundreds of people had kissed. And I just flat out refused through a tantrum. Made a scene, and from that day on remember being a out-and-out atheist.</p><p>My personal definition of agency is, overarchingly simple. It is recognising that you are in control of your own life. You have everything at your disposal to change, to make a change, to be different, to not be a victim of the things that happen to you. Said in a more succinct way, I believe that I happen to life, life does not happen to me.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>I was never pushed to have agency, I was also never held back</strong></h2><p>I don’t recall high agency being encouraged, punished, or ignored specifically when I was growing up. My parents were always quite liberal in terms of what they allowed me to do or not to do. They didn’t necessarily punish me for going out on my own and doing things that were different or unique. They also didn’t reprimand or restrict my freedom.</p><p>So at the age of 11, when I was given an internet-connected computer, they didn’t micromanage what I did on that computer. They let me free. With agency and a curious mind, I went on to the internet and taught myself how to code and how to hack someone’s computer and how to build websites and how to connect with other people and chat to them on chat forums.</p><p>So while I was never pushed to have agency, I was also never held back from my curiosity and my interests. My mom, being a good old Greek mother, definitely imparted a sense of self-belief in me that anything was possible! That I could do anything, be anything, say anything. And that definitely helps with agency when you know your mom tells you that everything you want you can have and everything you do you can do.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Learn the rules, but ignore them</strong></h2><p>My assumptions are, and have always been, really simple:</p><p>Learn the rules, but ignore them.</p><p>It’s really important to understand what permissions, rules, and authorities exist and how they impact and impinge upon your freedoms and your life. But the truth is they don’t matter! Rules, laws, permissions were put in place by humans just like me who came before me, and I don’t really buy into that. I have my own very clear idea of what is moral, what is ethical, and I understand the law so I can operate within it.</p><p>And I do believe that these assumptions have always held me in good stead from a young age. I was challenged authority, questioned authority, and tried to understand authority, and I do believe that that helps people realise that agency is human imposed or restricted, and breaking out those human imposed restrictions is really up to the human that you are.</p><p>I love being wrong! I thrive on being wrong. I love being wrong in public. I think it’s one of the key ways that you learn. Being wrong is a sign of strength. Being vulnerable is a sign of strength, and being wrong in public is an open sign that you’re intellectually honest.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Starting before you’re ready is just living</strong></h2><p>I don’t know when thinking has gone on long enough! But I am definitely more of a “think, plan, build, iterate” kind of guy.</p><p>Starting before you’re ready to me is living. Nobody is ready to be alive. Nobody is prepared for what’s coming next. Starting before you’re ready is just walking down the street and crossing a road.</p><p>I’m actually afraid of not reaching my potential of living an unhappy life and not living as much of life as I could. I think that there are times to sit on the couch and watch TV, but those times are few and far between. Most of your life should be spent doing things, building things, improving things, and living as much of life as you can.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Failure is data, not destiny</strong></h2><p>I’ve accepted that failure is an active part of getting to success. While most people are fearful of trying in case they fail, I’m fearful of not trying in case I don’t learn what it takes to succeed. I do not believe that failure exists. The only type of failure is not trying. Failure is data, not destiny.</p><p>High agency always has the opportunity to backfire on you. The joy, the pleasure, and the pain of having and executing on your high agency is that every time it goes bad, you’re responsible for that.</p><p>I’m not really sure I’ve ever been interested in the concept of blame. I’ve always been interested in the concept of responsibility and ownership. I can’t help myself but step up into leadership positions, take responsibility for teams, take ownership of what people are doing and saying so that we’re all aligned.</p><p>When something fails, everybody should instinctively look at the data first. You should look at everything that the failure teaches you, tells you, points towards, and then you should use that to iterate.</p><p>High agency definitely influences the way that someone experiences guilt or regret. For me specifically, I definitely regret the things I did. I have very few regrets on the things that I didn’t do because of my agentic approach to life: I’m leaning in, not leaning out.</p><p>Agency, ownership, responsibility are all tied very closely together. It’s easy to blame somebody else if you haven’t taken responsibility and ownership for the actions that you took.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>I do not comply</strong></h2><p>Rules, processes, and red tape are emotionally repugnant to me. They are frustrating but necessary evils. Constraints are good. However, too many rules, too many constraints, too much process, too many alignment meetings, too much working around the work and talking about the work vs. actually doing the work is why many product teams and startups fail because they’re more interested in looking good than doing good.</p><p>People with high agency don’t want complete freedom; we want direction.</p><p>We want to work with the best people.</p><p>We want to work with budgets that we control.</p><p>We want to be able to iterate quickly, engage with customers, and control our own destinies.</p><p>We want to take responsibility for our failures as well as our successes.</p><p>We don’t like politics.</p><p>We don’t like bullshit.</p><p>Yes. I have been labelled “difficult”, “misogynistic”, “aggressive”, “intense”, “non-compliant”, and every other variation of “this person does not comply”. And I wear those brands as a mark of honour because I do not comply.</p><p>Shipping is more important than polish because polish doesn’t give you data, shipping gives you data, failure gives you data, action gives you data.</p><p>Working in an environment that rewards low agency and doesn’t move bad people out of the way is gut-wrenching, soul-destroying, and like death by 10,000 paper cuts. Eventually, you realise that the work environment doesn’t support high agency and just wants to be filled with yes-men who are telling the leaders what they want to hear instead of building the right solution for the customers.</p>
