<p>Over the past couple of months I have spent some of my evenings and weekends solving a problem I’ve had for years. </p><p>The problem is simple: I uncover amazing links that I want to save and read later but I always forget to read them or where I’ve saved them. </p><p>So I built <a href="http://savistash.com">Savistash</a> - save links, close tabs, curate a personal newsletter. The entire process has left me gobsmacked. </p><p>Using <a href="https://replit.com/refer/nicharry">Replit</a> it’s so easy and cheap to create software that it’s almost free to build a working version of anything you can imagine. At least a working-enough version to figure out product market fit (PMF). I can hardly believe that I managed to build <a href="http://savistash.com">Savistash</a> in my spare time while just a few years ago I needed to assemble a team of people, raise money, quit my job and start a company.</p><p>So let me tell you about this project… </p><h2>What is <a href="http://savistash.com">Savistash</a>?</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="http://savistash.com" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png" width="1219" height="223" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:223,&quot;width&quot;:1219,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79312,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;http://savistash.com&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://nicharry.substack.com/i/164705304?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tiC1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde60220-c610-45f5-8554-045eff4837bf_1219x223.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In short, turn your saved links and bookmarks into your favourite newsletter. </p><p>Register a free account (14 free trial). </p><p>Install the Chrome Extension (on Chrome, Edge, Dia, any chromium browser) and then browse the web. See it in action:</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;0d259aec-5e5b-4ecc-bdbb-653d0bab6839&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>One click and you save the article and choose to add it to your weekly newsletter or just simply save the link to find later. </p><p>Then you decide when you want to receive your newsletter (daily, weekly, whenever) and Savistash automagically sends you a newsletter from yourself of your favourite links for the week. </p><p>“But nobody reads newsletters anymore, duh.” ← there’s always that guy, right!? Here’s the thing - you ignore newsletters you don’t want. <strong>This is a newsletter you curate and choose to send to yourself so hopefully you’re pretty high up on your own priority list!</strong></p><p>I’ve used Pocket (which is shutting down) in the past but I kept forgetting to open the app for reading purposes. I save links and never see them again. I’m also not a power user so more expansive (and expensive) tools turn me off because the learning and maintaining curves are just too high for me. </p><p>So that’s why I created <a href="http://savistash.com">savistash.com</a>… for myself. To help <em><strong>me</strong></em> save links, select which ones <em><strong>I</strong></em> want to read next and then add those to <em><strong>my own personal</strong></em> weekly newsletter. </p><p>Stash links now. </p><p>Close those tabs. </p><p>Read links later. </p><p>Simple.</p><h2>What did I build myself? </h2><p>Here’s the thing, I built everything. </p><ul><li><p>The design. </p></li><li><p>The front-end functionality. </p></li><li><p>The backend functionality. </p></li><li><p>The pricing model and Stripe integration.</p></li><li><p>The Chrome Extension. </p></li><li><p>Pocket link migration (yes if you’re currently a Pocket user, you can migrate for free to Savistash). </p></li><li><p>A/B testing. </p></li><li><p>Landing pages. </p></li><li><p>Advertising tracking pixels. </p></li><li><p>Analytics integrations.</p></li><li><p>Everything. </p></li></ul><p>This may seem like a simple product to ship but let me tell you that in the past, without the AI tools I’ve used for thinking, coding, design, strategy, copy, this would be a full-on startup that I’d raise funding to build over years and hire a team of people. Just look at Pocket. Or, rather don’t. </p><h2>The Big Ask</h2><p>I don’t want this to be a billion-dollar business. I could care less about that. I want Savistash to break-even so that I can use it indefinitely. That’s it. I want 1000 paying users and I’ll be happy. </p><p>So here’s my ask:</p><ol><li><p>If this is a service that appeals to you, <a href="http://savistash.com">Sign up</a> and use Savistash (14 day free trial). </p></li><li><p>Send it to a friend - hit that “Forward” email button right now and send this to someone who reads a lot online. </p></li><li><p>Share it on LinkedIn/Facebook/X/TikTok/Instagram as an example of what non-technical people like us can build now. Here are some post ideas: </p><ol><li><p>“Can you believe this guy built an entire business using AI tools in 30 days: Savistash.com”</p></li><li><p>“Curate your own newsletter as your browse - Savistash.com”</p></li></ol></li><li><p>If you have an opinion, hit Reply and send it to me, don’t be nice, I can take your feedback. </p></li></ol><p>Help me grow this into a sustainable business so I can continue to use my own tool! </p><p>This is the future of how people build things; solve your own problems and bring other people along for the ride if they have a similar problem. </p><p>—</p><p>Stay curious, </p><p>Nic</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Here’s a list of a few ways I used AI this week.</em></p><ul><li><p>Built an entire self-driven course about a new Keynote topic (<strong>Reply and ask me about it if you’re looking to hire a speaker!</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Generated a marinade recipe to pair ribs with a Korean-inspired tofu dish</p></li><li><p>Explained the interaction between diazepam and Vitofyllin in senior dogs</p></li><li><p>Identified the purpose and meaning of Dutch bike registration stickers</p></li><li><p>Analysed causes of stomach ulcers and gave tailored advice for symptom relief</p></li><li><p>Clarified what Dutch carrots are and why they differ from standard varieties</p></li><li><p>Created a dosing history summary and reminder flow for medical tracking</p></li><li><p>Evaluated green tea, Coke Zero, and other drinks for gut comfort compatibility</p></li><li><p>Reviewed and rewrote a landing page headline and structure for Reports dashboard</p></li><li><p>Helped with visual prompt creation for an AI and human collaboration newsletter image</p></li><li><p>Answered questions about the Israeli-Iranian conflict and bombing context</p></li><li><p>Explained vitamin D synthesis in tablets vs. sunlight exposure</p></li><li><p>Reviewed my investment portfolio and adjusted portfolio allocation based on new goals</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><em>To hold myself accountable I want to share updates about my side projects every newsletter.</em></p><h4>New</h4><p>All my focus has been on <strong><a href="http://savistash.com">Savistash</a></strong>, as you can tell, so the below is mostly unchanged from the last newsletter. </p><p>1000fifteen - An app to help me learn the 1000 most frequently spoken Dutch words and speak basic sentences. </p><p><strong><a href="http://splitville.co">Splitville</a></strong> - I’m not giving up on this one! I found an open-source project that I’m going to try and implement to restart this. </p><h4>Significant progress</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1432332696794120370/decision-tracker">Decision Tracker</a> </strong>- 232 users, 12 likes and 3 comments. No new updates or releases. </p><h4>Still running</h4><p><strong>GoodGoodweeds</strong> - Changed the name and still tracking my own weed reviews until I can get this out in the world! A weed review site. Early development and currently testing out Leafy to see if it's worth me even pursuing Goodweeds.</p><p><strong><a href="https://stumblesong.com/">StumbleSong</a> </strong>- No change. Still around, still working but I haven't made any changes this month.</p><h4>Deadpool</h4><p><strong><s>Flirtbot</s></strong> - Moved to deadpool, dating apps have started adding this functionality natively. </p><p><strong><s>PositionMe</s></strong> - Moved to deadpool. I think monetising this would be too complex. An app for couples who want to try new sex positions. You both rate various positions and the app then suggests the most compatible options to you to try.</p><p><strong><s>BucketListAssist</s> </strong>- Added to the deadpool May 2025. Too complex for me to stay engaged.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dreamy-praline-408a97.netlify.app/"><s>Pixeldash</s></a></strong> - Added to the deadpool - 20 April 2025. I don’t want to build games. While this is still live on the domain, no progress has been made and I’ve decided game dev is fun for the weekends but I want to spend my time on solving problems. </p><div><hr></div><p><em>A list of links that I think are worth saving and a short breakdown of why I shared it with you.</em></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://world.hey.com/jorge/anyone-can-cook-c6346f84">Anyone can cook</a> (not a cooking article).</p></li><li><p>MIT says <a href="https://x.com/itsalexvacca/status/1935343874421178762?s=46">ChatGPT is making us cognitively bankrupt</a></p></li><li><p>A <a href="https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1928819467540169151?t=3LAbGaMIzBXnTdveumnuvg&amp;s=19">simple guide</a> to not being laid off</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/chamath/status/1927737524920959259">Two kinds of people in the world.</a> (I don’t love Chamath, but I agree with this take).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1927444638735966221?t=gPIDcxVOS68uo5CFCUQqRA&amp;s=19">It's not weed making people losers</a>, it's that people who are losers are more likely to use weed.</p><p></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p>If you made it this far, to me a huge favour and share this with someone.
