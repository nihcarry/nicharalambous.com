<p>A few months ago I was watching an episode of <em>Chef’s Table: Legends</em> on Netflix. The one with Jamie Oliver. Watching a 24-year-old Oliver talk about food is riveting. He preaches simple, healthy food in its most natural form at the very start of his career. His first cookbook and TV show focus on this theme. He showed such passion at an insanely young age for something so clear, so simple, and so pure.</p><p>It almost feels like Oliver always knew these things and was just waiting for the moment to talk about the obvious truth that nobody else understood.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg" width="1200" height="753" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:753,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="News" title="News" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3IiB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dd3dd6-c6da-45d5-872c-74447e1259c7_1200x753.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I watched the rest of this episode in a bit of a daze, to be honest. The pure passion that I witnessed in such a young person absolutely floored me. At 41 years old, what am I so certain of? What am I so confident in that I would be willing to write a new book, pitch a TV show and stand on stages across the world? What is the thing that I deeply understand that could change the world?</p><p>I came up with nothing.</p><p>Months of thinking, analysing, probing, studying, researching, talking to friends and… nothing. Not a fucking thing.</p><p>So I just carried on living my life.</p><p>Then a few months later I ordered a pair of shoes that didn’t fit as expected. Don’t you hate it when you’ve been wearing a certain brand - <em>cough,</em> <em>New Balance,</em> <em>cough -</em> for years and years, and you order the exact same size that you’ve ordered for years and years, but the shoe suddenly doesn’t fit? Me too. But I loved these shoes, so I decided to investigate why this particular shoe doesn’t fit me vs my previous 20 or 30 pairs. I discovered that it’s not me, it’s the shoe. They added some extra (unwanted) padding to the heel of the shoe. This extra padding pushes the foot forward and shoves the big toe to the front of the shoe, cramming your foot in there aggressively.</p><p>I did not return those shoes, though.</p><p>I studied the shoe. I asked my AI buddy what went into the foam, how the heels are usually made, and if I wanted to remove the heel padding, how would I do that.</p><p>And then I cut the shoe.</p><p>I cut that bastard padding right out of the heel of those shoes, taped up the hole, and slipped my foot into the shoe. It fit!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:340297,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://nicharry.substack.com/i/170254607?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JOGK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F419b7524-bd4a-488f-a1ab-579064da417b_2016x1134.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And in that exact moment, it hit me.</p><p><strong>High agency.</strong></p><p>That’s what I know.

Taking action matters more today than ever before.

How to tell the difference between good and bad agency. How your teams can foster agency, and how leaders can promote and nurture high agency in their organisations.</p><p>Mediocre is over, folks. AI is better than the most mediocre human already. That means that mediocre doesn’t even get you into the game. You know what does? That’s right: high agency gets you into the game.

Wait, no, I haven't been this excited since I started building things with AI tools. The combination of AI tools + high agency is the future for those willing to step up.
