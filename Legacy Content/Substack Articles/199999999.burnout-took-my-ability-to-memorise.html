<p>One of the more unexpected consequences of severe burnout has been what it's done to my memory.</p>
<p>I used to memorise my keynotes without too much trouble. Not perfectly, not robotically, but reliably. I knew the beats. I knew the transitions. I knew how it all hung together.</p>
<p>After burnout?</p>
<p>It's felt like trying to load a large file onto an old computer.</p>
<p>There's this deep underlying lack of confidence that creeps in. That subtle second-guessing that's very hard to escape. But there's also something more physical: a brain that is genuinely slower than it used to be. Still recovering. Still rebuilding.</p>
<p>And no matter how much I tried to brute-force it, I just couldn't seem to get my keynotes into my head.</p>
<p>I'd rehearse.<br>Miss a word.<br>Skip a sentence.<br>Misalign a segue.</p>
<p>Then spend the rest of the run-through slightly off-balance, fumbling forward on rocky ground, frustrated with my broken brain, broken confidence, broken self.</p>
<h2>Remembering That Memorisation Is a Solved Problem</h2>
<p>Then, a few weeks ago, I remembered a book I read years ago: Moonwalking with Einstein.</p>
<p>It's about a journalist who trains to become a memory champion. What struck me back then, and hit me again now, is that memorisation isn't mystical.</p>
<p>It's mostly solved.</p>
<p>There are techniques.<br>There are methods.<br>There are processes.</p>
<p>It isn't about raw talent and brutal determination to force specific words and sentences into your memory in a specific order. That's what teleprompts are for. It isn't about "having a good memory." It's about applying systems.</p>
<p>That was strangely comforting.</p>
<p>Because if it's a system, then it's trainable.</p>
<p>And if it's trainable, then even a slightly slower, slightly bruised brain can rebuild.</p>

<h2>The Big Lie About Repetition</h2>
<p>Most of us believe something that sounds reasonable but isn't actually true:</p>
<p>Repetition leads to memorisation.</p>
<p>If I say it enough times, eventually it'll stick.</p>
<p>But that's not really how memory works.</p>
<p>What repetition often creates is fragile recall. You're not remembering meaning. You're remembering sequence. And the moment you miss a word or skip a phrase, the whole structure collapses. This is exactly what I have been feeling, fragility in my approach.</p>
<p>I wasn't forgetting the ideas.</p>
<p>I was forgetting the script and the ideas weren't really ever committed to long term memory in the way I needed them.</p>
<p>I have been treating the script and the ideas as if they were the same.</p>
<p>They're not.</p>
<h2>Building The Memorizer</h2>
<p>So I decided to build something for myself and see if AI could help me.</p>
<p>The Memorizer is a custom GPT that takes a talk, keynote, presentation, speech, script, anything you need to internalise, and breaks it down using established memory techniques and a learning schedule.</p>
<p>Not just "read this again tomorrow."</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural chunking</li>
<li>Memory hooks</li>
<li>Thematic anchors</li>
<li>Spaced reinforcement</li>
<li>Recall practice instead of passive rereading</li>
</ul>
<p>It forces you to engage with the material differently.</p>
<p>Not as a script to recite.</p>
<p>But as an idea to inhabit.</p>
<h2>Memorising Meaning, Not Sentences</h2>
<p>Here's the shift that changed everything for me:</p>
<p>Your memory is going to change your sentences on the way out.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>Some phrases will land better.<br>Some slightly worse.<br>Some transitions (segues) will evolve.</p>
<p>And that's okay if you're aware of it and embrace it. If you're expecting a very specific arrangement of words to come out of your mouth every time, then you are going to be frustrated and disappointed with yourself.</p>
<p>What actually matters on stage isn't sentence fidelity.</p>
<p>It's clarity of thought, emotional conviction and structural coherence.<br>It's whether you understand what you're saying deeply enough that it still stands if a few words move around.</p>
<p>The Memorizer is built around that principle.</p>
<p>You're not trying to preserve a fragile string of perfect wording.</p>
<p>You're building a mental map.</p>
<p>When you have the map, you can always find your way back.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters (Beyond Keynotes)</h2>
<p>This whole experience has reminded me of something slightly uncomfortable:</p>
<p>Sometimes when we think we've "lost our edge," what we've really lost is our method.</p>
<p>Burnout took a toll on me, there's no denying that.</p>
<p>But part of my frustration was also trying to rely on old habits instead of adapting to what my brain needs now.</p>
<p>There's something oddly hopeful in that.</p>
<p>Systems can be rebuilt.<br>Muscles can be retrained.<br>Confidence can be reconstructed from structure.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try The Memorizer, I'd love you to.</p>

<p>This started as something I built for myself.</p>
<p>But I suspect I'm not the only one who's tried to brute-force their brain and wondered why it wasn't cooperating.</p>
<p>And if this helps even one person feel a bit more solid on stage, or in a boardroom, or in front of a camera, then it's done its job.</p>
