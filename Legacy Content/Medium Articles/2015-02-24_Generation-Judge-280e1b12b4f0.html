However, it just doesn’t sit well with me that <a href="https://medium.com/@umairh" data-href="https://medium.com/@umairh" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Go to the profile of umair haque" target="_blank">umair haque</a> feels it appropriate to lay judgement on what we choose, as Generation Stupid, to spend out time doing.</p><p name="2bab" id="2bab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just because one person doesn’t find value in “FaceTinder. UberDrones. Watching people play videogames…” doesn’t mean that others don’t. On top of that, a generation or two ago there was a faction of people thinking: “These idiots watching images dance around on a screen. What a load of rubbish. What’s wrong with sounds through this radio?” And before that there was a generation who could not understand why someone was speaking to them through a metal and wooden box when their children had perfectly decent words on parchment to read.</p><p name="99f4" id="99f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Generation Judge is tedious and smug. Don’t tell me that SnapChat isn’t worth spending my time on. What do you know about how the tens of millions of people using it spend their time engaging with it? They could be doing any number of things that are edifying their lives.</p><p name="ffe1" id="ffe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On some points, however, Umair and I agree. The main one being the Kardashian’s and their inane existence. However my take on this is simple; those millions of people watching stupid, mind-numbing television are simply getting out of the way for the rest of us who are working are asses off to make a difference in the world. I don’t want all those empty minds cluttering things up for us who are looking for what Umair deems to be appropriate life goals. If KimYe makes them happy, then so be it.</p><p name="e975" id="e975" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Speaking of life goals that Umair feels are worth pursuing. He mentions Stability twice. Twice (see what I did there?). I think Umair sounds bored and boring. Some people don’t want stability, Generation Judge. Some people find stability to be stifling. Some people want to jump out of planes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/raskalovit/videos" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/user/raskalovit/videos" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">climb buildings</a> and post about it on SocialSnapTubeFaceTweeYakPlace.</p><p name="62d7" id="62d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s highlight some of the deepisms that are mentioned as goals to work towards: Meaning. Purpose. Happiness. Let me rephrase those so we can all understand them: Subjective. Subjective. Subjective.</p><p name="595f" id="595f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stop judging my meaning, Leave my purpose alone and as for my happiness, stuff off you arrogant member of Generation Judge. Leave me alone and let me find my meaning, purpose and happiness.</p><p name="7daf" id="7daf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What the fuck is wrong with you, Generation Judge?</em></p><p name="12c1" id="12c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why do you think you know better? Why do you feel the need to point out the ignorant, stupid and frustrating parts of a generation? Why not highlight those that toil away every day to make a difference, to change things and make the world better?</p><p name="f782" id="f782" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe you need to read more, expand your horizons and find the people who are actually doing something with their lives instead of worrying yourself about butt implants and free porn.</p><p name="eb03" id="eb03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">By the way — what’s wrong with free porn? You sound like a bit of a conservative prude to me. Perhaps the Internet isn’t the right place for you to hang out with Generation Stupid?</p></div></div></section><section name="8d40" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="57cf" id="57cf" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I understand what Umair was trying to achieve with his angry and misguided post about finding your true North and seeking things that have real meaning. Unfortunately if you scratch the surface of the rubbish being sprouted it’s actually just a thinly vailed reaction to things that are misunderstood, misplaced, misrepresented and looked down upon.</p><p name="53b4" id="53b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hate stupid people. But even more, I hate people who claim to fight for freedom by scolding people for being free to choose what they do with their time.</p><p name="5634" id="5634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may not agree with everything that an entire generation does but I’d appreciate it if you stopped lumping an entire generation of people together and then judging them.</p><p name="7889" id="7889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My final point on this is simple: Who do you think is reading this article right now? People fighting for “Jobs. Careers. Homes. Stability. Healthcare. Money. Stability. Democracy. Civil rights. A planet. Freedom. Meaning. Purpose. Happiness.” or the second list of people that you hate so much?</p></div></div></section>
