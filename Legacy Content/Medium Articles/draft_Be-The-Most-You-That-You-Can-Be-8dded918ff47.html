But you didn’t look like him and you weren’t as talented as him and you didn’t imagine you could be as famous as him by just copying what he did. </p><p name="be7f" id="be7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, that’s exactly how people believe they can become famous; by copying what other famous people have done. The tricky part is how we’re experiencing fame. In the golden age of film and music, there were a handful of people around the world who were considered to be famous. Today there are literally tens of thousands of people who have bigger audiences than the stars of yesteryear.</p><p name="aebf" id="aebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think I’m kidding? Here are just a few to get you thinking:  </p><ul class="postList"><li name="08f5" id="08f5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">David Dobrik — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">16.1m</strong> YouTube followers</li><li name="690e" id="690e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Charlie D’amelio — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">32.7m</strong> TikTok followes and 1.8bn likes (she’s 15 years old)</li><li name="44be" id="44be" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Casey Neistate — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">11.9m</strong> YouTube followers through his daily vlogging</li><li name="8677" id="8677" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Lilly Singh — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">14.9m</strong> YouTube followers</li><li name="b34c" id="b34c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ninja — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">22.9m</strong> YouTube followers</li><li name="9e99" id="9e99" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">thefatjewish — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">11m</strong> Instagram followers</li><li name="4106" id="4106" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Liza Koshy—<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">18m</strong> Instagram followers.</li></ul><p name="06d3" id="06d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">These are regular people. Inherently, there is nothing too unique about them yet these people each have an audience larger than the size of New York. Give that some thought. We believe that media outlets influence our lives, they don’t. These people do. </p><p name="2000" id="2000" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been using TikTok recently and it has been a trip, let me tell you. It’s filled with young people being themselves and getting famous for it. Never before have we seen a platform that can turn a simple 60-second video into a career of fame and fortune so quickly. You can post something unique and interesting and reach 1 million likes in a day. It’s insane. </p><p name="d878" id="d878" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the thing — the people succeeding on these platforms (InstaFaceTokTube), the ones who are really leading the way, are being themselves. They are being <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the most version of themselves</strong> that they can be. </p><p name="d0b0" id="d0b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone else is following or copying them. Everyone else is following and copying because social media lets us believe that we are just like Charlie with her 32.7m followers. She’s just a kid who likes dancing. Young people see her and think to themselves “Hey, I’m a kid, I like dancing, I can do that.” And then we get pissed that we aren’t famous after we upload. </p><p name="8f04" id="8f04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are copycats, of course. And there are people who can dance better than Charlie or put on makeup better than so and so or kick a ball better than blah blah blah. Sure, but if it isn’t your thing then it isn’t the most version of you and you’re fucked. </p><p name="5373" id="5373" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Acting like something is not the same as being that thing. </p><p name="3d23" id="3d23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Faking a passion for dancing isn’t going to make you a famous dancer. Faking an obsession for cooking wont make you a famous chef. </p><p name="b8d7" id="b8d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@finlidrappermusic/video/6798492929406143750?u_code=d369bfea3aihih&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;timestamp=1583008007&amp;utm_source=more&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;share_app_name=musically&amp;share_iid=6797959968563562246&amp;source=h5_m" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@finlidrappermusic/video/6798492929406143750?u_code=d369bfea3aihih&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;timestamp=1583008007&amp;utm_source=more&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;share_app_name=musically&amp;share_iid=6797959968563562246&amp;source=h5_m" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Finlidrappermusic</a>’s account. This guy is a drummer and all-rounder musician. He’s incredibly gifted and likes to play tunes using glasses of water that are filled up to make different sounds. He could’ve just set up his drumkit and played drums and then posted to TikTok, but he didn’t. He chose to be the most version of himself that he could be. He didn’t look to anyone else, he just did the thing that he was doing and people loved it. </p><figure name="8dec" id="8dec" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6798492929406143750" width="340" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="cff1" id="cff1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are examples of this all over the world and throughout time. Yes, copycats exit and yes they can make a lot of money doing what they do (copy) and do it well. But the ultimate question lies in front of them: Are they happy?</p><p name="cc80" id="cc80" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1566" id="1566" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="3c0e" id="3c0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">-</p></div></div></section>
