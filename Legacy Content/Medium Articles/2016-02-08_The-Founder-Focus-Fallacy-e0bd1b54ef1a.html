Don’t have too many product positions. Don’t constantly build, pivot, flip, start another business on the side, try a different angle, etc, etc, etc. Focus on a single goal and hustle at it over time.</p><p name="2e68" id="2e68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just focus and it’ll all come right if you hunker down for long enough on one thing. Be the best at that one thing.</p><p name="aa28" id="aa28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure. One thing.</p><p name="23ce" id="23ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me, that one thing is socks. Believe it or not, I have built a business on the heel of <a href="https://www.nicharry.com/" data-href="https://www.nicharry.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daring socks</a>.</p><p name="1597" id="1597" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me tell you how my “one thing” days look as the founder of a startup…</p><p name="fb70" id="fb70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wake up at 5:45am and my phone is buzzing with customer enquiries and live chat support requests about shipping, product information questions and more.</p><p name="cd35" id="cd35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I answer those and then check my email, play with my dogs and knock off a few things from my to do list: deep etching products for the website, writing a blog post, putting together our weekly newsletter which entails photo editing, linking, tracking and other things. I might schedule some Facebook adverts, Tweets, Instagram posts and then start my Snapchat story for the day.</p><p name="98ba" id="98ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I might then receive a notification that the alarm in our store is broken. I have to call to get that fixed. We have IP Cameras installed in our stores so I have to figure out how those work on my devices. Then it’s near month end so I have to get on top of sales, stock management and transfers for the day/week/month.</p><p name="847d" id="847d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also have figure out staffing schedules and shifts, manage HR, contracts, training and other company culture related issues that come into play when you go from 2 to 7 staff in a couple of months.</p><p name="75c1" id="75c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, due to the nature of our multichannel business I’ll have to get my head into the game of shop design and fitting. Once our retail store is up and running, I am deep into the sales process of every new store, manning it every day, all day so I can learn the ins and outs of my stores.</p><p name="abd3" id="abd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The four paragraphs above indicate that I suffer from a severe lack of focus.</p><p name="e506" id="e506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When all the great entrepreneurs, investors and business writers discuss focus, they mean broad focus. They do not mean that as a founder of a startup you can only focus on a single part of your business.</p><p name="720e" id="720e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That level of focus at an early stage startup is virtually impossible.</p><p name="138e" id="138e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d like to suggest that experiencing the guts of your business from top to bottom and back down again is an imperative part of gaining insight into your business.</p><p name="a719" id="a719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Founder focus is a fallacy.</p><p name="6bbb" id="6bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t let it ruin your business early on.</p><p name="1c18" id="1c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you stare at the sun too long, you’ll go blind. If you focus too hard on one area of your business, it may go blind too.</p></div></div></section>
