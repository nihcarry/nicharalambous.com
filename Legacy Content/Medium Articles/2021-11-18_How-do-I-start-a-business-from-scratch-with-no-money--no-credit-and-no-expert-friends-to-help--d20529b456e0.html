If you intrinsically understand good design don’t pivot away from that to build your business. Don’t try to learn a new skill while trying to build a new business (which is a new skill you’re learning). Take one thing you are amazing at and use your muscle memory there to make your life easier. Pivot towards things you’re good at, not away from them.</p><h4 name="a56e" id="a56e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">You don’t have a time problem, you have a priority problem</strong></h4><p name="0e44" id="0e44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most first-timers don’t think they have enough time to build their business. They worry about competitors beating them to the punch, the market falling from under them or their timing being wrong and missing the opportunity they see.</p><p name="e34a" id="e34a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These things could all happen but are mostly out of your control. Worry about what you can control: your priorities.</p><p name="7bf4" id="7bf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s the #1 priority for a new business? Selling. If you can make one sale you have validated that a person wants to part with money for something you’ve built. Prioritise this and forget about not having enough time.</p><h4 name="d057" id="d057" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Nobody is waiting for you to fail</strong></h4><p name="8363" id="8363" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“What will people think.” ← The five scariest words to a new entrepreneur. Here’s the truth — nobody cares about you and nobody is thinking about you. 99.99999% of human beings on the planet don’t know you exist. So act like, be free and build whatever you want.</p><h4 name="695d" id="695d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Everything you need to know has been published online already</strong></h4><p name="5867" id="5867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve never had a mentor in the traditional sense. I read a lot, I watch YouTube videos, I try things that others have tried and then fail. But I have always been a quick learner and I hold strong opinions very loosely.</p><p name="019f" id="019f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t need a mentor to build anything, you need to get started. So use the tools at your disposal: Books, blogs, twitter, tiktok, youtube, podcasts, etc etc etc. Access to great minds has never been freer.</p><h4 name="7644" id="7644" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Upgrade your friends</strong></h4><p name="7dfd" id="7dfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you still really, really want a mentor then I suggest you upgrade your friends. Harsh but true.</p><p name="352d" id="352d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you only hang around corporate employees with no entrepreneurial drive and spirit it’s going to be much more difficult to become an entrepreneur. Find people you want to be like and talk to them, ask them how they did what they did and put your pride in your pocket.</p><p name="f1ef" id="f1ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of my best friends had no choice but to become friends with me because I popped up wherever they were, slid into their circles and voraciously learned from them. Go to founder events, find startup Discord channels, follow TikTok entrepreneurs and engage with them, comment on their posts. Go local and meet with people like yourself. It’s difficult but not even close to impossible. The only roadblock is your ability to be lazy.</p><h4 name="e417" id="e417" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Just because you don’t value your skills doesn’t mean they’re not valuable</strong></h4><p name="6495" id="6495" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A big mistake that first-time entrepreneurs make is thinking that the skills other people have are more valuable than your own skills. If you know how to knit exceptionally well then you have a skill that is valuable. You should use that skill and try to make your first sale.</p><h4 name="a8cf" id="a8cf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 3 F’s</strong></h4><p name="2a09" id="2a09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Friends, Family, Fools ← are the people you sell to first. Those are the people you talk to about your idea. Those are the people you lean into when you’re just getting started.</p><p name="3055" id="3055" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fools are early adopters, people who like to try new things and are much more relaxed than the standard customer. Find them and sell to them, get their feedback and enjoy the ride with them.</p><p name="2b61" id="2b61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally…</p><h4 name="2769" id="2769" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">DO NOT BOTHER WITH A BUSINESS PLAN</strong></h4><p name="d749" id="d749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Business plans are an extreme waste of energy when you’re starting out. It’s a roadblock that MBA graduates insist help them build better businesses.</p><p name="d8bd" id="d8bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of spending your time and energy writing out words that will be obsolete 3 months into building your first business, answer these three questions:</p><p name="d8a5" id="d8a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What are you selling?</p><p name="8f97" id="8f97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who are you selling to?</p><p name="7e86" id="7e86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where do you find them?</p><p name="7537" id="7537" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Then go talk to those people about your business.</p></div></div></section><section name="6571" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="2f7d" id="2f7d" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading graf--trailing">If you like my no-bullshit approach to business and you’re looking for a coach to help you build a better life and a better business, <a href="https://nicharalambous.com/business-coach" data-href="https://nicharalambous.com/business-coach" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">let’s talk</a>.</h4></div></div></section>
