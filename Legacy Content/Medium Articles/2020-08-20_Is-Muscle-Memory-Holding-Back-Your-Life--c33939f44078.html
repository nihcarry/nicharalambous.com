If you’re not sure what the hell that is, watch this:</p><figure name="cf61" id="cf61" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RS_jUrt9Xi0?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="142f" id="142f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What you are witnessing is a combination of an incredible amount of data, pattern recognition, finger dexterity and algorithms all coming together in under 7 seconds of brilliance.</p><p name="7fd8" id="7fd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The documentary tells the viewer that most of the professional speedcubers memorise up to 300 different algorithms that they can then combine to solve any of the 43 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintillion" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintillion" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Quintillion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quintillion</a> possibly permutations. When you think about it this way it’s quite an incredible achievement but in truth, it really is just about practice and muscle memory.</p><p name="e759" id="e759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The concept of muscle memory is often just thought of in a sporting context. You teach your physical muscle to remember something by practising that thing over and over and over again.</p><p name="9a9f" id="9a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I haven’t played the guitar in a couple of years but the other day I picked one up and strummed away. Muscle memory.</p><p name="f792" id="f792" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This documentary really got me thinking about what other kinds of muscle memory I use and teach myself every day. When I stopped to consider the endless things I do every day it’s actually quite overwhelming.</p><p name="10f1" id="10f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The one that I want to focus on is the one that we probably think has the least impact on our lives: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">self-talk</strong>.</p></div></div></section><section name="b3da" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="854b" id="854b" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">THE START SOMETHING NEWSLETTER</h3><p name="3af6" id="3af6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Join thousands of others as we all #StartSomething new and challenging.</p><h4 name="fc11" id="fc11" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://nicharalambous.com/start-something-newsletter" data-href="https://nicharalambous.com/start-something-newsletter" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SIGN UP NOW</a></h4></div></div></section><section name="d9eb" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="023b" id="023b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Self-talk occurs when you tell yourself that you can or cannot do something. When you tell yourself that you do or do not deserve something. When you think you’re not smart enough or pretty enough or that you shouldn’t eat that or you should do more of something because of XYZ. These micro-moments throughout your day are either helping you to become a better version of yourself or they are teaching you to be too hard on yourself, setting you up for failure before you’ve even begun.</p><p name="4f35" id="4f35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are considering a new venture or job, if you think you might deserve a better partner or a raise at work and you talk yourself out of taking that first leap you are teaching yourself that you don’t deserve good things.</p><p name="2a41" id="2a41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your brain remembers this and over time you don’t even have the conversation with yourself, you just stop trying.</p><p name="5069" id="5069" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The muscle memory we employ every day really does matter and just like any skill, you can teach yourself to be and do just about anything (within the limitations of the natural world of course).</p><p name="c664" id="c664" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next time you catch yourself talking shit to yourself I want you to stop and think about why and then I want you to get irritated with yourself and stop it.</p><p name="20df" id="20df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Positive self-talk takes a conscious effort to get right but frustratingly negative self-talk is easy to let slide and not notice. Take notice of how you talk about and to yourself because words really matter. But that’s a topic for a different article altogether.</p></div></div></section>
