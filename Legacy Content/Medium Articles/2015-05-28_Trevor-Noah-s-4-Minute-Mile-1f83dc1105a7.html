People began to believe that it might be impossible and that humans just couldn’t run the mile in under 4 minutes.</p><p name="4eec" id="4eec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then On May 6, 1954, Roger Bannister ran a mile in 3 minutes, 59.4 seconds.</p><p name="4e8f" id="4e8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From History.com: His world record in the mile did not stand long, and the record continued to be lowered with increasingly controlled climatic and surface conditions, more accurate timing devices, and improvements in training and running techniques.

I live in South Africa and believe it or not, Americans, I have never met Trevor. I’ve seen him live and he is genuinely funny. I’m really happy for Trevor, mostly because I’m South African and so is he and hard work deserves to be rewarded.</p><p name="05fd" id="05fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a few days after the news broke Trevor was the talk of the world and even more so in South Africa. I knew it was big. I knew that it mattered but I really couldn’t put my finger on the reason that Trevor Noah replacing Jon Stewart was a big deal.</p><p name="9d41" id="9d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Until I spoke on stage with the immensely funny <a href="http://goliathandgoliath.com/" data-href="http://goliathandgoliath.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jason Goliath</a>.</p><p name="7ede" id="7ede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This article isn’t about Trevor Noah. This article is about Trevor Noah’s 4 minute mile and what it means for comedians from around the world.</p><h3 name="9e64" id="9e64" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Mr Goliath</h3><p name="d472" id="d472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Listening to a comedian on stage is very fulfilling. If they are funny, it’s a pleasure to watch them. Jason is funny. Really funny. He’s actually hilarious and intelligent and is clearly very driven.</p><p name="6360" id="6360" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the first time I heard Trevor’s success story through the eyes of a local comedian as Jason was telling it to the audience. Jason summed up the importance of Trevor’s appointment to the show perfectly.</p><p name="a2b9" id="a2b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He explained that before Trevor made it onto The Daily Show he didn’t know what it meant to really make it as a South African comedian. He thought that selling out a single show overseas was something incredible. Being really famous abroad wasn’t really part of his goal because comedians from small countries just don’t make it big.</p><p name="ffa0" id="ffa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then Trevor really made it. Since that moment, everything changed.</p><h3 name="5acd" id="5acd" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Size Of It</h3><p name="fc89" id="fc89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you Google it, Jon Stewart was earning ±$30m before leaving his position on The Daily Show. Let’s guess that Trevor Noah could be making a third of that figure because he’s just starting out. That makes him an immediate hundred-millionaire in South African rands. Let’s quantify that amount:</p><blockquote name="fc23" id="fc23" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Cashiers in South African earn an annual income of ± R42 000.</blockquote><p name="f851" id="f851" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Trevor Noah could be earning R100 000 000 a year at his regular day job. That’s the equivalent annual salary of 2380 cashiers in South Africans.</p><p name="31dd" id="31dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d say that for comedians across the world that kind of money is life-changing.</p><p name="d53f" id="d53f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">For many that kind of money is now attainable thanks to Trevor Noah.</p></div></div></section><section name="b7f8" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf--leading"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HhoIol5eqeBwbTQz9Y2Ynw.jpeg" data-width="2000" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*HhoIol5eqeBwbTQz9Y2Ynw.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="ec8d" id="ec8d" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure graf--trailing">If you liked this article, please take a second to click the “Recommend” button below.
