I love having someone question my worldview or the way I do something or a belief that I hold to be true. I didn’t always enjoy the experience of people telling me I was wrong. There was a time that I would become extremely defensive and end up in shouting matches with close friends whom I greatly respect. </p><p name="8c52" id="8c52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The human condition often dictates that when we are challenged, we viciously defend our point of view at all costs. Our established positions are comfortable and we adore the bubble that we have created for ourselves. </p><p name="de7a" id="de7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the past 3 months, I have suffered 2 root canals in two separate teeth right night to one another. I have received two fillings in those root canalled teeth. I have seen 2 dentists and one periodontist. I am still in pain and haven’t been able to chew on the left side of my mouth for about 4 months. </p><p name="30f5" id="30f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t particularly care about the pain any longer. I hope it will subside and the root canals and fillings eventually work. </p><p name="0846" id="0846" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What absolutely blew my brain was the way the periodontist treated me when I went back to him for a second, second opinion. </p><p name="a968" id="a968" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b437" id="b437" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b2d9" id="b2d9" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="892b" id="892b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="2929" id="2929" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This entire ordeal (yes, it has been upgraded from a dental visit to an ordeal) made me think about how I approach situations and prepare myself mentally. Is my default to be defensive or do I go in with an open mind willing to learn and listen?</p><p name="7392" id="7392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason I visited 3 different medical practitioners for my tooth pain is that the first one was too aggressive wanting to rip my tooth out of my face. The root canal apparently didn’t work and that means the tooth needs to come out. This is a costly decision. </p><p name="ab98" id="ab98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sought a second opinion from the periodontist. He is an older man with lots of experience who in the past, apparently, also sat at the head of the dental ethics committee for some time. He sat with me for about 11 minutes and referred me to another dentist. I paid a lot of money for those 11 minutes. </p><p name="250e" id="250e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went to this new dentist who proceeded to give me my second root canal, on a different tooth. I only found out that this was a different tooth when the previous dentist</p><p name="708e" id="708e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="46f4" id="46f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Went to periodontics </p></div></div></section>
