I just want you to consider what the world would look like if we all were more open about our goals and our needs.</p><p name="3640" id="3640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Would we be happier knowing what others need? Would it be a more pleasant world to live in to know that your employee wants a raise in 4 months if they hit certain targets? Would you be angry if your child told you that they just needed 2 hours alone without you?</p><p name="b78d" id="b78d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Could you handle the truth?</p><p name="f249" id="f249" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wish this was life. I long for this kind of reality.</p><p name="53ed" id="53ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is so much anxiety tied to not knowing. So much stress that goes along with the unsaid and undone.</p><p name="0601" id="0601" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know it’s not easy and I understand it wont take hold overnight but I want to ask you to do something now:</p><p name="2232" id="2232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Be more honest today. Just today. For one day.</strong></p><p name="12e0" id="12e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t be mean. Just be honest.</p><p name="5fed" id="5fed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If someone asks you how you are, don’t lie. Tell them you are tired because you watched Netflix too late last night. If someone asks you what you’d like for lunch, tell them exactly what you’d like even if they likely can’t make it or buy it for you.</p><p name="c0ff" id="c0ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your partner asks you what you want to do over the weekend, think about it and tell them.</p><p name="c364" id="c364" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s it. That’s all I want from you today. One day of increased honesty.</p><p name="a856" id="a856" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps you’ll tell you boss exactly what you want out of the next 12 months of work. Perhaps you’ll tell your lover exactly what you want in bed tonight. Perhaps you’ll tell your family that you love them and really mean it. Perhaps you wont have the guts to be honest. I don’t know. But I want to find out.</p><p name="c3f9" id="c3f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Comment</strong> on this article when your day of honesty is over and tell me about it. What did people say? What did people think? How did they react? How did you feel? Was it easy or difficult to do?</p><p name="6110" id="6110" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After one day of honesty, tell me if you’d do it again.</p><p name="a162" id="a162" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of my Nicisms that I live by is: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Be honest if possible.</strong></p><p name="a68c" id="a68c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not always the best idea to be honest, I get that. But when it’s possible you should choose to be honest.</p><p name="d0bf" id="d0bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think the world needs a bit more transparency, openness and honesty when it comes to our communication. I want to decipher less and serve more. I want to be baffled less and useful more. I want more honesty.</p><p name="84a5" id="84a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">How about you?</p></div></div></section>
