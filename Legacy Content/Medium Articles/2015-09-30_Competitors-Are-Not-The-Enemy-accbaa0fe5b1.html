Competition isn’t one of them.</h4><p name="688a" id="688a" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h4"><span class="graf-dropCap">I</span> started an online socks company almost 3 years ago. Since then there have been a number of competitors that have launched in South Africa. I started <a href="http://www.nicharry.com" data-href="http://www.nicharry.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nic Harry</a> because I had been wearing a brand called Happy Socks and wanted more. Happy Socks is the gorilla in the sock room with distribution in over 6500 stores globally. They are massive competition for me.</p><p name="484f" id="484f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason I bring this all up is that recently I’ve been receiving a lot of tweets, emails and phone calls telling me about my competitors and what they do and how they do it. Many people are shocked that anyone else is copying my idea (<a href="http://www.nicharry.com" data-href="http://www.nicharry.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">colourful socks</a> are not my original idea btw) and doing it so brazenly. Some people point out amazing things that other brands are doing and ask “have you considered something like that?”. While others point to the perceived success that said competitor is having and “doesn’t that worry you?”.</p><p name="cc26" id="cc26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love that people are interested enough in my brand to take the time to point out my competitors. It means they’re thinking about Nic Harry and that they love what we do. I appreciate that but I’m not listening when you talk about my competitors.</p><p name="e739" id="e739" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">L</span>et’s talk about competitors.</p><p name="9f5a" id="9f5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Competitors are many things but they are certainly not the enemy. Competitors prove that there is a market for you to try and own. I’ve never seen a product that exclusively dominates a market.</p><p name="baaf" id="baaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I own many pairs of sneakers, various denim brands, I’ve owned a few different car brands over the years as well as multiple mobile devices and the truth is that one of those opened me up to an entirely new way of thinking that inevitably led me to their competitors. This experience helps to grow the market size, not shrink it.</p><p name="2897" id="2897" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A rising tide lifts all ships, as they say. So from where I stand (yes, on my socks) the more my competitors can open the market up, the more people I have to sell to and win over.</p><p name="ce78" id="ce78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If, after all of this, you are wondering who is the enemy, let me tell you…</p><h3 name="1ea3" id="1ea3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bad Design Is the Enemy</h3><p name="4f45" id="4f45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A fundemental focus in my business is design. The logo design, sock design, product design, the design of our brand aesthetic, the store design which embodies our brand aesthetic, the scent that we’ve developed so that you can smell our brand, our website, emails, tweets, instagrams and everything inbetween. Design is everything.</p><p name="5eda" id="5eda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I look at my competition occassionally, I understand that placing such a great focus on my design and brand from day 1 has been a critical differentiator but it had nothing to do with them. It was a decision we made on our own, to be great at design.</p><h3 name="2380" id="2380" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Weak Product Is The Enemy</h3><p name="79dd" id="79dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You can have the best market position, the most customers, the best design in the world and fantastic distribution but if your product is weak everything falls down.</p><p name="e1eb" id="e1eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Get your product right and the rest will follow.</p><h3 name="0cb8" id="0cb8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bad Cashflow Is The Enemy</h3><p name="ef89" id="ef89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Well done. You now have great design and a great product. But if your sales aren’t growing and the money isn’t coming in then you’ve got a problem. Sometimes great design and a good product aren’t enough. Yes, it sounds like I’m contradicting myself. This shit is complicated and there’s no quick fix.</p><p name="a4b2" id="a4b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your sales are going down in the face of a great product and amazing design then you’re missing a trick. Something is wrong and you best get back on the bus and figure it out.</p><p name="c2a8" id="c2a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In one of my previous businesses we built technology that allowed end users to create mobile social networks using their phones. We had a good product and users but we weren’t making any money. No one wanted to pay us for the service. The product eventually had to change and major shifts had to take place.</p><p name="0f16" id="0f16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sales are imperative. Without money coming in you aren’t really a business.</p><h3 name="8b03" id="8b03" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Small Margins Are The Enemy</h3><p name="447c" id="447c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You think your competitors are killing it. You feel like they are everywhere. You project that they’re doing huge turnover every month.</p><p name="bbbc" id="bbbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the truth is that you don’t know their business. You don’t know what their margins are. You don’t know what they’re paying themselves (maybe they’re paying themselves too much and have less cash in the bank than they should). There are so many variables in the equation that it makes my brain hurt.</p><p name="f365" id="f365" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What you do know is your own margins and cost base. Focus on that. Jeff Bezos is famous for trying to squeeze margin out of his suppliers and partners so he can pass the savings onto his customers. For Amazon, margin means customer satisfaction and therefore growth.</p><p name="c17d" id="c17d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t focus on what your competitors might be doing, focus on how you can improve your margins.</p><h3 name="9c3f" id="9c3f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Customer Churn Is The Enemy</h3><p name="cdac" id="cdac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I love hearing about my competitors and how happy their customers are. I love hearing that because I know they can’t sustain that happiness as well as I can in my business.</p><p name="19aa" id="19aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We go out of our way to make sure we get and then keep the best customers for our brand. We don’t lose customers that often and when we do we try our fucking hardest to get them back.</p><p name="368b" id="368b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Losing customers can destroy your business for obvious reasons but sometimes it’s not obvious that you’re losing them so pay attention.</p><h3 name="4762" id="4762" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Distractions Are The Enemy</h3><p name="ad8d" id="ad8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s easy to jump onto Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook or any other distracting social media platform and search for your competitors. It’s easy to feel like they’re outpacing you in the world when you look at their social stats but it’s important to remember that brands on social media shows the world what they want the world to see.</p><p name="922e" id="922e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No business is going to post their terrible third quarter sales figures to their Twitter account or Facebook page. They’re going to talk about their TV interviews, their PR and other vanity metrics to make themselves feel better about their shitty performance.</p><p name="91c1" id="91c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Keep your head down, focus on your strategy and build your business. Ignore the distractions, they are the enemy.</p><h3 name="09d0" id="09d0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Weak Strategy Is The Enemy</h3><p name="4be1" id="4be1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Blindly building things can sometimes lead to magic. But that’s very rare and probably not you or me.</p><p name="06b1" id="06b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the whole, great businesses are built through hard work, determination and on a premise that a problem exists that needs to be solved. Once the business is alive, a carefully planned (and sometimes reactionary) strategy has to be crafted and executed.</p><p name="bdd0" id="bdd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you focus on your competitors too much you will lose sight of your brand strategy. If this is happening to you maybe it’s because you don’t fully back your strategy and decisions. Maybe you need to refocus on your own strategy and ignore your competitors for a few months while you get your house in order.</p><p name="78e9" id="78e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d rather (and do) ignore my competitors as much as possible. I try to educate myself and build the right strategy for my business in the world right now and for where I see it moving to in the next ten years.</p><h3 name="8e4c" id="8e4c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bad Execution Is The Enemy</h3><p name="578a" id="578a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s great that you have all the moving parts taped down and ready to go. If you can’t manage the execution perfectly then the chances are, you’re going to struggle whether you have competitors or not.</p><p name="1c75" id="1c75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you get distracted and focus too intensely on what everyone else is doing you’re going to screw up what you’re doing and execute badly.</p><h3 name="607d" id="607d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bad Customer Service Is The Enemy</h3><p name="e54c" id="e54c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Customer service is easy to do and can become a huge differentiator for your business.</p><p name="f837" id="f837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Customer service has become so important because there are so many options available to consumers. The Internet and ecommerce have allowed consumers to buy product from, quite literally, anywhere in the world. You are competing on a global scale whether you want to admit it or not. You better up your game and compete with the best, not the competitors closest to you geographically.</p><h3 name="3e1a" id="3e1a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Ignorance is the enemy</h3><p name="4397" id="4397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Don’t be ignorant about your industry, competitors, trends and insights. Take time to read about how the greats think, work and plan. Research industry trends and stay on top of the movers and shakers in the space.</p><p name="0b33" id="0b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I often bump into the founders of other businesses that compete with me directly and engage them in conversation about what we do and what they do. I even make plans to see some of them on a monthly basis. It’s important to remember that keeping in touch is not the same as obsessing over. Keep in touch with your industry, competitors and insights but don’t obsess over them.</p></div></div></section><section name="f30e" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="ed87" id="ed87" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading"><span class="graf-dropCap">If</span> you have a decent grasp on some of the things above then I can confidently tell you to forget about your competitors because you’re doing OK. I often take solace in the fact that very few people can get all of this right all of the time.</p><p name="bef8" id="bef8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The market is always large enough for many players to stake a decent claim and build a valuable business.</p><p name="869f" id="869f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You are not playing a zero-sum game.</p></div></div></section><section name="4cb3" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="ef5b" id="ef5b" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--trailing">If you liked this article, you’ll freakin’ love my newsletter: <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" data-href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up now</a>!</h3></div></div></section>
