I had a very numb face and very little control over the volume of saliva being produced while the dentist battled with the awkward shape of the mouth and position that teeth find themselves in.</p><p name="7254" id="7254" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since I had nowhere else to go for the 45 minutes of numb-faceness, I started to imagine what it would be like if the dental assistat wasn’t there sucking the saliva for the dentist. Let me tell you, it would have been an absolute shambles. My mouth would fill up with saliva, it would drip down the side of my face (which is actually a pretty thick beard which means I’d have a damp face for a while) and onto my shirt. It would make the job of fixing my broken tooth a very difficult task for the dentist who would have to stop every few seconds to hold the saliva-sucking device up to my mouth and clear things out.</p><p name="0f72" id="0f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, this may seem pretty obvious to most people but for me it highlighted a very important thing: You can’t build things alone.</p><p name="1aaf" id="1aaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Most of the time the journey is better and easier if you have people you trust working with you on a shared vision. Everyone needs a saliva-sucker to be by their side making the path that little bit easier and a tiny bit clearer.</p></div></div></section>
