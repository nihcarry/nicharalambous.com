The guy started to tell me about his recent trip to New York. I love New York and secretly take pride in how well I know the city.</p><p name="c481" id="c481" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the guy was telling me about the epic trip he took all I could think was: “What do you do for a living to afford a trip like this?”. The helicopter ride over Manhattan, the incredible hotels, the whole tripe sounded pretty lavish and sounded pretty damn expensive. So I asked what he did for a living and was surprised to find out that he distributes a type of cream that is used to heal scars and skin blemishes. Nice, simple, tidy and extremely respectable business that clearly shoots the lights out.</p><p name="d80a" id="d80a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But on the way home I started to get angry. I was angry that the things that I do take so long to work out. I was angry that his simple idea had taken off and that mine were still in their infancy.</p><p name="a0d5" id="a0d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I immediately felt guilty about this anger and my partner pointed out that this happens to me a lot.</p><p name="febe" id="febe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I get frustrated and angry and analytical when I hear about other people doing well.</p><p name="8900" id="8900" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is hard for me to admit because it comes across as jealousy but it’s something I want to get control of and explain a bit further.</p><p name="e47e" id="e47e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t dislike successful people or their success. I don’t judge them or begrudge them.</p><p name="f707" id="f707" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m angry at myself.</p><p name="d7db" id="d7db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m angry that I watched that extra episode of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Halt and Catch Fire</em> last night. I’m angry that I didn’t work that tiny bit more on Sunday. I’m angry because there are a lot of hungry and driven people out there making it work and I should be working harder, faster and smarter to make what I’m doing a huge success.</p><p name="8b85" id="8b85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m proud of entrepreneurs who have made it. I’m enhtralled by their stories and always so happy to meet them and hear about how they did what they did. I eat up every possible ounce of information and knowledge I can from these people but unfortunately sometimes I can sound (and feel) bitter.</p><p name="e2e3" id="e2e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the nature of the beast. The beast is competitive spirit. I can’t say that I never feel jealous or irritated by other people. I do. And I’m sure they do too.</p><p name="d92f" id="d92f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I can tell you is that when I wake up the morning after meeting other entrepreneurs doing well I am more driven because success is that much more tangible. What I can tell you is that I feel like I’m competing with everyone and I want to beat everyone I encounter. That’s the nature of competitive spirit.</p><p name="f153" id="f153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Meeting successful people helps me understand that it’s possible to build something incredible. I respect them for that but I don’t have to like it.</p></div></div></section><section name="361b" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a0ab" id="a0ab" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--trailing">If you liked this article, you’ll freakin’ love my newsletter: <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" data-href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up now</a>!</h3></div></div></section>
