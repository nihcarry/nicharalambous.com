I recently rebranded &amp; relaunched my online sock company. Here are a few things I learned.

I engage with people in real time, I’ve created a product that people are proud to wear and one that they actively tell people about. Without a doubt, building trust and a great product have been the best things I could have done. The branding is less important when you’re only two years old.</p><h3 name="0fd6" id="0fd6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Why?</strong></h3><p name="9811" id="9811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Niche is good when you’re starting out. NicSocks.com started out as a premium, limited edition, online sock company. We did socks by subscription, manufactured and designed the socks ourselves and managed all of the distribution, marketing, pr, media, content creation. Everything. Typical startup approach to building a business.</p><p name="9b15" id="9b15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I chose to keep it niche because that makes it manageable and quantifiable. I was trying to prove that people (men specifically) wanted to buy premium accessories online.</p><p name="4275" id="4275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the first year that theory was proved and I realised that there was a much broader opportunity for us in men’s accessories. So I began planning a rebrand.</p><p name="e728" id="e728" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I launched the company’s new identity (<a href="http://www.nicharry.com/" data-href="http://www.nicharry.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.nicharry.com</a>) last week which has been well received.</p><p name="4ff0" id="4ff0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are a few things I re-learned, discovered and want to share:</p><h3 name="9d7d" id="9d7d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Do It Right</strong></h3><p name="c132" id="c132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you’re going to rebrand, get a professional to do it. Unless you are a full time illustrator and brand expert you’re probably not qualified to create a new brand positioning for your company down to the actual logo design. Get help.</p><p name="e146" id="e146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called on <a href="http://simaclennan.com/" data-href="http://simaclennan.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Si Maclennan</a> who I can’t recommend highly enough. In terms of value for money, efficiency and final result, he was incredible.</p><p name="d855" id="d855" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thanks to David Perel at <a href="http://oboxthemes.com/" data-href="http://oboxthemes.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Obox</a> I wrote an extremely detailed brief with examples of the aesthetic I was going for which helped to make the new logo and identity design a smooth process.</p><p name="5e26" id="5e26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what we launched last week:</p><figure name="6931" id="6931" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*FlT_uYg1Z2TZn9BVf2m7PQ.jpeg" data-width="1322" data-height="452" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FlT_uYg1Z2TZn9BVf2m7PQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="8ba0" id="8ba0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We wanted the brand to be able to withstand product shifts, retail moves and trends coming and going.</p><p name="8061" id="8061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall the new identity, logo and product direction tie in perfectly together and have helped to move the company towards an expanded future.</p><h3 name="a876" id="a876" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Seek Advice</strong></h3><p name="71e7" id="71e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">While considering the rebrand I decided to speak to key people who I thought could give me a decent perspective on what its like to rebrand a business and change direction.</p><p name="08cb" id="08cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The person who gave me the best advice was Luke from <a href="http://superbalist.com/" data-href="http://superbalist.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superbalist</a> (formerly Citymob).</p><p name="78ab" id="78ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luke and his team spent a good few years building up their domain and brand as CityMob but realised that it wasn’t the right direction to take them forward. So they made the massive decision to rebrand.</p><p name="22dc" id="22dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I met with Luke they were already past their rebranding and had successfully navigated through the hardships.</p><p name="13cb" id="13cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luke gave me a single piece of advise that he told me he had received from a good friend of his:</p><blockquote name="b8fc" id="b8fc" data-align="center" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">No one gives a shit.</strong></blockquote><p name="68cf" id="68cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">What fantastic advice. It caught me offguard. I left feeling a bit frustrated that Luke’s advice wasn’t more sage in it’s presentation. But there it was. No one gives a shit.</p><p name="161c" id="161c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A week into our new identity and Luke’s advice could not have been more correct. People support your company, its product and the way you go about conducting yourself. Not your logo.</p><p name="cbf6" id="cbf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, if Nike had to change names there would be one helluva fuss kicked up. But I’m not Nike and we’re only two. So if there’s a time to change, make it now.</p><h3 name="04b9" id="04b9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Prepare</strong></h3><p name="5a2a" id="5a2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Launching a new identity is brutal. It’s easy to get into the everyday work mode of a business and go about your routines. It’s hard to stop everything, take the time out to handle the detail that needs to be done before you can go live with a new name, url, logo and colour palette.</p><p name="58bd" id="58bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the Checklist:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="800a" id="800a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Domains</li><li name="5d87" id="5d87" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social handles: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+</li><li name="04da" id="04da" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Design Social Assets: Headers, Icons, etc for FB, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+</li><li name="66ae" id="66ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Email setup on new domain (this one almost broke me)</li><li name="2b49" id="2b49" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Analytics Tracking</li><li name="7ae9" id="7ae9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Webmaster Tools</li></ul><p name="575f" id="575f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">These things are just the start. As you go through the list and tick things off, more things become unticked and emerge that you’ll need to firefight.</p><p name="bd36" id="bd36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Myself and Dave (from <a href="http://oboxthemes.com/" data-href="http://oboxthemes.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Obox</a>) managed to get through the day without too much trouble having done this a few times before but there are numerous road blocks that can destroy your willingness to live.</p><h3 name="ba12" id="ba12" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Imagery Creates Brand</strong></h3><figure name="f897" id="f897" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wbsHXDCgUiz-fzwYJjMP0Q.jpeg" data-width="1000" data-height="1506" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wbsHXDCgUiz-fzwYJjMP0Q.jpeg"></figure><p name="25f7" id="25f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The major difference between the NicSocks website and the Nic Harry relaunch is the imagery that we used.</p><p name="7393" id="7393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called on a fashion photography expert to oversee this part of the new identity. <a href="http://danilloturilli.com/" data-href="http://danilloturilli.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Danillo Turilli</a> did a fantastic job and I was there throughout the process to make sure that I was involved in every aspect of how the brand I had in my mind was translated into photographs.</p><p name="9e78" id="9e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is another part of the process that I am glad I decided to pay top dollar for. A great logo and amazing photographs set our site apart from many of the others in our space.</p><h3 name="a27e" id="a27e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Keep Calm</strong></h3><blockquote name="a9fe" id="a9fe" data-align="center" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h3">Do. Not. Panic.</blockquote><p name="5d1b" id="5d1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Yes, something will go wrong. Yes, you will be gutted when it happens and need to lie down for a few minutes to get over it. But, you will carry on. You know why? Because if you don’t carry on, you’ll have a half-cocked new identity ready to fire. No one wants that.</p><p name="5935" id="5935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Go all in or don’t bother to start.</p><h3 name="e2a1" id="e2a1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Timing</strong></h3><p name="caa5" id="caa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I committed to a minimum of one full day of downtime to get the new site live and all the various aspects changed over to the new identity. I had also resigned myself to the fact that if it went on for another day, that’s OK too. Rather get it right than get it rushed.</p><p name="5a2f" id="5a2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately the relaunch took us about 30 solid hours of work (obviously not including the 6 month preparing our packaging, marketing, product expansion and doing consumer research).</p><p name="ffcc" id="ffcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best advice I can give here is to not start the process at 10pm at night. You’ll be tired, there will be no-one around to help you or support you or for you to moan to.</p><blockquote name="dd60" id="dd60" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Give yourself enough time to do a good job.</blockquote><h3 name="608e" id="608e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Deliver On The Details</h3><p name="677e" id="677e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There is every possibility that I have missed some details around our rebrand. However I did take care with some of the most important. One of the main details that I am proud of is how Nic Harry packages product.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="ff64" id="ff64" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hMIbbt80v2T3MgcOzArdRQ.jpeg" data-width="4288" data-height="2848" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*hMIbbt80v2T3MgcOzArdRQ.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fdc9" id="fdc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It took months of work and preparation to get our new packaging design and the actual boxes right. In fact, we are still working out some of the kinks with the factory that produces the boxes from scratch.</p><p name="2f5e" id="2f5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We do everything bespoke and unique to our aesthetic and the unwrapping process is one of the most integral to our customer experience.</p><blockquote name="4b61" id="4b61" data-align="center" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Don’t ignore the details. Someone always notices.</blockquote><h3 name="83f6" id="83f6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Enjoy It</h3><p name="4f3a" id="4f3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most important in this entire process is to enjoy it. Yes, it is brutal to rebrand, relaunch, rework, struggle and endure strife but underpinning all of it, I had fun.</p><p name="3fc6" id="3fc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you don’t have fun and embrace the experience then all you’ll remember is the hellish time you had when you became something new.</p><p name="e2bc" id="e2bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You want to remember the entire experience fondly so that when you retell the story and create the narrative, it’s authentic and one that people can empathise with.</p></div></div></section><section name="2598" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="64bb" id="64bb" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Nic Harry is a premium men’s accessories company.</p><p name="3b39" id="3b39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We dress men from the ground up.
