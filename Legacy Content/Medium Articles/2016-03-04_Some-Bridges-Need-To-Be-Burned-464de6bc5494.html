I do the right thing in the face of personal loss, injury or harm. I do the right thing when everyone else would do the opposite. I’m honest to a fault. I am an ethical business person and I run my companies accordingly.</p><p name="995f" id="995f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately ethics are open to debate.</p><p name="8968" id="8968" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often the right decision for your business can appear to be unethical and devious to others. This is something I’ve had to come to terms with. I hate letting people down and I hate coming across as devious or dishonest. But Sometimes it’s the only way to go.</p><h4 name="4deb" id="4deb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Trying To Please Everyone Will Kill You</h4><p name="94b3" id="94b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I just <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/fear-of-missing-business-opportunities-4d79cc431431?source=latest---------2" data-href="https://medium.com/swlh/fear-of-missing-business-opportunities-4d79cc431431?source=latest---------2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">published an article</a> about the fear of missing a business opportunity (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/fear-of-missing-business-opportunities-4d79cc431431?source=latest---------2" data-href="https://medium.com/swlh/fear-of-missing-business-opportunities-4d79cc431431?source=latest---------2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">FOMBO</a>) and how it can lead to huge and unnecessary pressure for startups. The concept of wanting to say yes to every opportunity speaks directly to making tough decisions that appear to be unethical. The more you take on, the more decisions you’ll have to make.</p><p name="c320" id="c320" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Entrepreneurs see opportunity everywhere and have an endless stream of ideas. This is what makes us unique but it’s also what destroys a lot of businesses. Every opportunity I say yes to is a new commitment of time and resource that my company may not be able to afford.</p><p name="7c0a" id="7c0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Planning carefully is an important part of growing.</p><p name="1cb1" id="1cb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Growth at the rate of destruction can sneak up on you. It’s this exact scenario that I was faced with today.</p><h4 name="a2ec" id="a2ec" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Burning Bridges</h4><p name="fc3d" id="fc3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="http://www.nicharry.com" data-href="http://www.nicharry.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nic Harry</a> is dealing with some pretty intense growth at the moment. That means that scaling our business has become enormously complicated. We are selling more socks than ever before and each month we’re selling more socks than the last month.</p><p name="98b3" id="98b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We produce our socks in Cape Town, proudly and we ship to over 20 countries around the world. We also have 3 of our stores and this is where the complications begin to emerge.</p><p name="ad15" id="ad15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we’ve grown, so too has our retail distribution into other stores. Recently I had to cancel a retail order that has been on the go for a while. The retailer ordered a large amount of socks from us that we realised we just couldn’t afford to sell to them. We’re short stocked and need to keep the stock in our own stores.</p><p name="4319" id="4319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I stepped in and against my teams wishes I canceled the order.</p><p name="b7f3" id="b7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a big call. As an emerging brand I don’t want to tarnish our reputation with anyone but I also don’t want to have empty stores.</p><p name="32d2" id="32d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I made the hard decision to take all of the stock we were selling at wholesale price to the retailer and cycle it into our own stores. This gives our customers a better direct experience and preserves our stores aesthetic and sales.</p><p name="258a" id="258a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rightfully so, the retailer called me and lambasted me for unethical business practice. She was right, from her perspective my decision wasn’t entirely above board. I left her in the shit. She has two days to find a new sock supplier and that isn’t ideal.</p><p name="a9c4" id="a9c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a long back story with this retailer that helped me make this particular decision. It involves them mistreating me, my team, our brand and product.</p><p name="c380" id="c380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It goes both ways. Ethics are open to debate.</p><p name="fb44" id="fb44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately I’ll never stock my socks in their stores again because they wont let me. I knew that would be the outcome and I had to make peace with that.</p><p name="8906" id="8906" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I burned the bridge. I had to. For the sake of my brand and the sanity of my team I lit the relationship on fire.</p><p name="165f" id="165f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sometimes you have to burn bridges to force yourself to move forward.</p></div></div></section><section name="83c5" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="38b2" id="38b2" class="graf graf--figure graf--leading"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lY8BKNQFNPosRmRF1Pi3cw.png" data-width="320" data-height="322" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lY8BKNQFNPosRmRF1Pi3cw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Snapchat: NicHarry</figcaption></figure><blockquote name="9da5" id="9da5" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Add me on Snapchat to hear more insights about this story and others: <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/nicharry" data-href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/nicharry" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NicHarry</a></blockquote></div></div></section>
