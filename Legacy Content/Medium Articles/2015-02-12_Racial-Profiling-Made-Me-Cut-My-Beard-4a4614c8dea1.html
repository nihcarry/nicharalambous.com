If you’re ignorant, that’s your problem. But my problem is that other people’s ignorance directly effects my ability to keep calm in the face of repeated stupidity.</p><p name="fbfc" id="fbfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve had a beard for a long time. It’s been almost two years since I was clean shaven and before that I would grow my beard out, shave it off and start again for kicks.</p><p name="4766" id="4766" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My beard has become somewhat of a personal trademark. However, occasionally that personal trademark is impinged upon by the media, propaganda and the general populations complete lack of ability to think for themselves or keep their mouths shut.</p><p name="c06c" id="c06c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not sure what it is that causes people to say the following things but I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard the following:</p><blockquote name="7224" id="7224" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are you converting to Islam?”</blockquote><blockquote name="1868" id="1868" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“Don’t get angry and bomb us now, [laughs]”</blockquote><blockquote name="0c17" id="0c17" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“What’s that under your shirt? [laughs]”</blockquote><blockquote name="8299" id="8299" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“Ah, hello Mohammed.” - Fully aware of who I am and that my name is Nic.</blockquote><p name="f711" id="f711" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I also frequently have people outright tell me that I should cut my beard off because it makes me look like a terrorist. When I say frequently, I’m talking about daily occurrences.</p><p name="f33a" id="f33a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t get me wrong, I understand that my darker Greek complexion, coupled with my facial hair make me look like I could be a descendant of a variety of cultures from around the world. That’s cool.</p><p name="f026" id="f026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does bother me is that people feel the need to racially profile me because I have a long beard. People assume that because I have a beard, the only explanation must be that I am a terrorist and going to bomb someone. This is insulting on so many levels but mostly because it paints every Muslim (or beard-bearing man) with the same terrorist brush that the media forces on us.</p><p name="d483" id="d483" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are we so far gone that independent thought is no longer an option to the average human being? We must believe that because the Western media tells us that men with long beards are terrorists that it is the truth. Think people, think!</p><p name="7e62" id="7e62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The other incredible thing here is how comfortable people feel to bring this up with me and make these racially charged remarks to my face. Imagine walking up to a black person and calling them the “N” word or the “K” word. Or making some racial cliché in front of the subject of the cliché. I mean it, actually take a second to imagine doing that. It’s the same thing. It’s not a joke, not to the millions of people you are branding terrorists because they have a beard. Again, I urge you to use your brains and a tiny bit of common sense before spewing the rubbish you hear from media outlets.</p></div></div></section><section name="47ce" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="aac9" id="aac9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">So I cut my beard to be a bit shorter. To me, that feels like I’ve lost the battle, and I believe that I have. I’ve had this beard for years and years and the remarks and ignorant racial slurs have not gone away and have actually become more intense and frequent. The media is winning. Ignorance is winning. Common sense, however, is losing.</p><blockquote name="92d4" id="92d4" data-align="center" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">We are not becoming less racist, we are becoming more racially aware.</strong></blockquote><p name="8482" id="8482" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">And unfortunately we are allowing the Western media to dictate how we feel about race and how we react to it.</p></div></div></section>
