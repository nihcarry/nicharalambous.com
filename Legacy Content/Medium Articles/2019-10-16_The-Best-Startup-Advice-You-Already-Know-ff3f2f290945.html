<section name="7eb4" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="cdb2" id="cdb2" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">The Best Startup Advice You Already Know</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="e113" id="e113" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hUItmMX1gdBLya0AwsIW_Q.jpeg" data-width="2607" data-height="1738" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*hUItmMX1gdBLya0AwsIW_Q.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="beb4" id="beb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have spent many years building businesses. In that time I have been on the receiving end of some incredible advice. Some of it has changed my businesses and life. Some of it works for other people but not me. When I look back and reflect on the most valuable advice, it’s never the obscure that wins out. Almost always it is the most obvious advice that I knew all along that has helped me the most. Timing (when you receive the advice) is the most important factor when you take on advice.</p><p name="6e08" id="6e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What follows is the advice that I would give to myself if I were starting a business today.</p><h3 name="c4cd" id="c4cd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">1. Get healthy</h3><p name="3d7d" id="3d7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For some idiot reason it has become cool to work yourself into the ground. Let’s put this to bed right now: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it is not cool to be unhealthy.</strong></p><p name="d7b3" id="d7b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most paradoxical thing I hear founders say is that they put their company first, before anything else. That is idiotic.</p><p name="9d50" id="9d50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, get your health sorted out then you’ll be at your best when you are engaging with your team, your customers and your work. If you haven’t slept more than a few hours a night for a month or two then I don’t believe that you are putting your company first. You are actually doing more damage than good. Go to sleep, get some rest and then come back even stronger.</p><p name="0b77" id="0b77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I look at health in a few very specific ways:</p><h4 name="1320" id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Mental health</h4><p name="751a" id="751a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If your mind isn’t healthy and you are unprepared to go into a startup then you shouldn’t start a company. If over time your mind begins to take strain, you should stop and get your mind right before continuing to build your company. It’s OK to seek help if you are feeling like you need it. I see a psychologist when I feel strain and it’s the best decision I made for my own wellbeing and that of my company.</p><h4 name="2414" id="2414" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Physical health</h4><p name="3aeb" id="3aeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I don’t want you to look like The Rock but I do want you to live to reap the benefits of your hard work. Releasing endorphins is a great way to stay motivated and energised. Make time for exercise and your day will be much more productive and you’ll be more effective.</p><p name="d97d" id="d97d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I try to do exercise at least four days a week. Not a lot of exercise, you don’t need to spend 3 hours a day at gym. Go for a run, do a yoga class, lift some weights or do whatever sparks your energetic interest. Just do something.</p><h4 name="8dd7" id="8dd7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Sleep</h4><p name="dfd6" id="dfd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Read this very carefully: go to sleep.</p><p name="7270" id="7270" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t need to code that extra 3 hours until 1am and wake up weary and feeling alone. You need to sleep. Without fail when I feel overwhelmed I can trace it back to a bad night sleep or no sleep at all. My stress levels and anxiety are directly tied to the amount of sleep I am getting over an extended period of time.</p><p name="1235" id="1235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, there are times when you need to work for a full week on a new project that requires extra effort but your default position cannot be 4 hours of sleep a night.</p><p name="0754" id="0754" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, Casey Neistat can manage with very little sleep and a 3 hour run every morning but he and his ilk are the exception, not the rule. You and I, we need sleep. Trust me. Get 8 hours of sleep and you’ll feel like a new person.</p><h4 name="019f" id="019f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Diet</h4><p name="fe9f" id="fe9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Stop eating shit.</strong> This one’s pretty simple. I don’t advocate for any specific diet that will make you feel like a machine. I do the following:</p><p name="4074" id="4074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Skip breakfast.</strong> Some call it intermittent fasting, some say they are calorie restricting. I just like to skip breakfast and eat my first meal at near 1pm every day. By skipping breakfast you cut out some calories and you are technically fasting between dinner and lunch.</p><p name="9e97" id="9e97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Eat mostly plants.</strong> My partner is vegan and that makes it extremely easy for me to eat a mostly plant-based diet. I eat vegan almost 5 days a week and that really suits me. Then when I feel like red meat, I have some. When I feel like fish, I have some. But mostly, I eat plants and stay away from processed foods and sugary drinks.</p><p name="0d99" id="0d99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cook more often. When I cook at home from scratch I find myself decompressing. I have a glass of wine, talk with my partner about her day, discuss things I’ve learned that day or read about and then we sit down and eat a healthy, home cooked meal. This is a great way to stay connected to the food you are eating as well as your partner when you cook dinner together. We cook together every night. Cooking dinner every night also helps to save money on lunch the next day as I get to take leftovers to the office. Cook more often, trust me.</p><h4 name="fbcc" id="fbcc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Relationships</h4><p name="529a" id="529a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I don’t have a lot of friends or relationships that I keep but the ones that I hang on to, I protect and nurture at all costs. The network of people you surround yourself with will be able to support you when you need it and they’ll be able to help you become more of a success (as you will help them) and the cycle then continues. It’s boring to be a successful startup entrepreneur alone. Nurture your relationships even if you have to cut out a few to make the important ones stick.</p><h3 name="734f" id="734f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2. Everyone feels like an imposter</h3><p name="f177" id="f177" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The next time you walk into a pitch, proposal or meeting remind yourself that everyone you are talking to feels like an imposter, just like you do.</p><p name="cf01" id="cf01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all suffer from that feeling that we don’t belong where we are in spite of external validation. That is, quite literally, the definition of Imposter Syndrome. Acknowledge what you are good at, admit what you are shit at and then remember that everyone feels like you do.</p><p name="0a9f" id="0a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s also alright to understand that you are going to feel unworthy sometimes. You’re going to doubt yourself and you are going to question your abilities. Take a breath when this feeling comes on and realise that it shall pass and you will pick yourself up and carry on. It’s OK to have bad days as long as you get over them and move towards the good ones.</p><h3 name="088b" id="088b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">3. Ego will destroy you</h3><p name="84e1" id="84e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s hard to acknowledge that you feel like an imposter if you are filled with ego. I’ve experienced my share of ego and still do to this day. But I am now painfully aware of the damage that a big ego can inflict.</p><p name="d368" id="d368" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I used to think that the best way to build the best business was to be the smartest and most competent person in the room. Now I believe that surrounding myself with the smartest people in the world is the only way to be the best version of myself.</p><p name="6e91" id="6e91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Acknowledging that my skills are different to other people’s makes it easier to see their skills and understand mine better.</p><h3 name="3812" id="3812" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">4. The more you fail, the more you succeed</h3><p name="5fce" id="5fce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This feels like the complete opposite of the thing you should be striving for, right?</p><p name="0c37" id="0c37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should be trying to succeed, not fail. You should be shooting the lights out, not yourself in the foot.</p><p name="45d8" id="45d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my experience, the more I have failed, the closer I have moved towards success.</p><p name="1b99" id="1b99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have learned that failure is the real indicator of success. When you fail you are trying new things, pushing the boundaries of what you think you know and how you think you do things. If you aren’t pushing and trying new things then it’s likely that you’re just doing what someone else has done but probably not as well.</p><p name="4996" id="4996" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It hurts to fail, I know.</p><p name="a357" id="a357" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://amzn.to/2MlDSwt" data-href="https://amzn.to/2MlDSwt" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I literally wrote the book on failure</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">.</strong></p><h3 name="2c9c" id="2c9c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">5. Define success</h3><p name="2b76" id="2b76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I am often stunned when I talk to people who want to or have started their own businesses because when I ask them why they started this business, they don’t have a clear answer.</p><p name="f9bb" id="f9bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you are starting out you should sit down with your co-founders (or yourself if you’re a sole founder) and aim for something. Do you want to be the biggest company in the world? Have the most employees? Reach $1m in annual profit? Grow your revenue to $1bn? Do you want to be able to work from anywhere in the world?</p><p name="57ad" id="57ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have to define success in very clear terms. You can redefine success later once you’ve reached your first successful benchmark but if you aren’t aiming for something very specific then I believe you’re in trouble.</p><h3 name="3ff3" id="3ff3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">6. Cashflow, cashflow, cashflow</h3><p name="5ce4" id="5ce4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Knowing the difference between cashflow, revenue and profit could save your startup.</p><p name="f737" id="f737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the early phases of a business cashflow is the most important metric that you should be paying attention.</p><p name="a0e1" id="a0e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Revenue</strong> — money made from sales.</p><p name="c178" id="c178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Profit</strong> — money left after expenses are deducted.</p><p name="150c" id="150c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cashflow</strong> — the amount and timing of payments you receive and need to make. ie: tomorrow you owe $1000 to a supplier. You have $100 in the bank but you are being paid $2000 in 7 days time. You do not have the flow of cash to pay your supplier tomorrow before you are paid in 7 days. Even though in 6 days time you’ll be profitable, today you are technically insolvent.</p><h3 name="2cee" id="2cee" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">7. Profit is better than funding</h3><p name="58dd" id="58dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Do you know when it is the best time to raise funding from outside investors? When you are profitable.</p><p name="feda" id="feda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Profitable businesses have leverage. Profitable businesses can survive indefinitely without funding if they manage their growth well. Profitable businesses raise money from a position of power. Profitable businesses can invest further in their product, team, growth and well being. Profitable businesses are sexy, smart and sensible.</p><p name="5fc2" id="5fc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Growth for the sake of growth is stupid. Growth to achieve profitability makes sense. The best kind of funding I can think of comes straight out of your profit.</p><h3 name="74cc" id="74cc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">8. Sell more, raise less</h3><p name="b2e3" id="b2e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before you start raising funding ask yourself if you can increase your sales in any way. It’s going to take you at least 6 months to really hit your stride when raising funding. It’s likely that your first round will take 12 months to fully close and the funding to clear.</p><p name="f44b" id="f44b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So instead of going out and raising funding, ask yourself if you could spend 6 months selling harder than you’ve ever sold before and keeping 100% of the business that you started. Sell more, raise less.</p><h3 name="7f00" id="7f00" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">9. A “maybe” is actually “no”</h3><p name="c574" id="c574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When you’re selling a product or feature it’s important to pay attention to the answer you get from the potential customer. If they give you a resounding “yes” then you’re on to something. This is extremely unlikely at the beginning. You’re still figuring out how to pitch and position your product or service. You’re still trying to understand your target audience and you’re still trying to find your feet.</p><p name="59de" id="59de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s much more likely that your first few sales calls come back with a soft “maybe”.</p><p name="23f9" id="23f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe is a killer. Maybe keeps you interested in the prospect of selling to this person. Maybe drains your time and attention and saps your focus from the new customers who might be a resounding “yes”.</p><p name="dbc4" id="dbc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When someone answers with “maybe” you need to close them hard and get them to a “yes” or a hard “no” response. If you can’t get them to a yes or no answer then I suggest you move on. This prospect is not your last so better to move on to the next one. There are lots of potential customers out there.</p><h3 name="5a20" id="5a20" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">10. Bigger does not mean better</h3><p name="d1c4" id="d1c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s hard to believe that this still needs to be said out loud but; a business with more staff, bigger offices and higher expenses is not always the best business.</p><p name="6749" id="6749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, in some instances having these things looks good and feels good but for most businesses out there, having 4000 staff members in 20 countries is never going to happen. I’m serious. It’s very, very unlikely that the business you are building right now is going to be be a billion dollar behemoth. The thing that we need to realise is that bigger is not always better.</p><p name="e96a" id="e96a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Profitable is better (see point 7 above). Define what success looks like for you and inch towards it (see point 5 above). You don’t need to keep a “headcount” (wow I hate that word) and you don’t need to expand offices, countries, continents, planets, universes. You just need to work out what success looks like for you and work towards it. It’s also OK if your definition of success is to list a company and employ thousands of people. Go for it.</p><h3 name="90dd" id="90dd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">11. Only work with the best people</h3><p name="696b" id="696b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At a startup you are constantly battling between budget to hire the best people and urgency to bring these people on board.</p><p name="0251" id="0251" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a founder (or the person recruiting) you are going to have to figure out how to attract the best people to your business. To start with, the best people are attracted by the best people. No A-player wants to work in a company filled with B and C players. If you start out hiring average people you’re only always going to attract average people.</p><p name="2cef" id="2cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even if you can offer the best people the most money and equity to join, eventually they are going to be frustrated with the team that surrounds them and they’re going to leave.</p><p name="a723" id="a723" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As an extra bit of advice to do with the best people — when you find them and bring them on board, if they really are the best and you believe that to be true, leave them to do their work. Let them be the best people in your organisation. Don’t micro-manage them.</p><h3 name="e934" id="e934" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">12. Burn. It. Down.</h3><p name="47fa" id="47fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A question I am asked a lot is when you should walk away from your startup and do something else.</p><p name="7bfb" id="7bfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no clear cut answer to this question unfortunately. The boundaries are different for everyone and context varies greatly from startup to startup and founder to founder.</p><p name="3669" id="3669" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, I do have a few questions that help my thinking:</p><p name="d819" id="d819" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you have fun more often than not?</p><p name="1430" id="1430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you still want to work with the people you see every day at work?</p><p name="7630" id="7630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you still believe that your idea can be a profitable and sustainable business?</p><p name="46fc" id="46fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is this still what you want to spend the next five years building?</p><p name="2975" id="2975" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you answer “No” to majority of the questions above then you should consider doing something else. Recognise that failure is a path to success, it’s the start of something new and not only the end of something old (see point 4 above).</p><h3 name="f91c" id="f91c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">13. Startups aren’t for everyone</h3><p name="9aef" id="9aef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Over the past 30 years it has become painfully cool to be a startup founder. Unfortunately this cool factor attracts a lot of entrepreneurs who are actually more suited to being employee number 5 or 10 at a startup. Being a founder is not for everyone.</p><p name="118f" id="118f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taking this a step further, working at a startup is also not for everyone. You are constantly in fight or flight mode and hunting for the next deal to get you to break-even or profitable. For many people this is a hugely motivating factor in the most positive way but for a very large part of the population this constant pushing and anxiety is not sustainable, even at an employment level.</p><p name="b247" id="b247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s OK to want a stable job at a big company that does good work. You don’t have to fight the startup fight, there is no shame in that.</p><p name="795d" id="795d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As long as you are making a conscious choice to be where you are do the thing you are doing then you’re going to be OK. If you fell into your situation and are suffering for it then you need to rethink your choices, consult the unsolicited advice above and perhaps make some new choices.</p></div></div></section><section name="8d5f" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="79f9" id="79f9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Photo by </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/@clarktibbs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@clarktibbs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Clark Tibbs</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/startup?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/startup?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Unsplash</em></a></p></div></div></section><section name="82a6" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="bd93" id="bd93" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">If you liked the article above, you may also want to buy my book DO.
