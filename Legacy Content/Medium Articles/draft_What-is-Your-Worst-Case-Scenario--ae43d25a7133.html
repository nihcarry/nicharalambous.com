We eat our own dog food, we drink our own Koolaid, we use our own products and we are obviously changing the world with our latest business. That’s how it feels when everything is moving in the right direction, and things are going well.</p><p name="3095" id="3095" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It happens this way in our personal and professional lives. When the graphs are moving upwards and to the right, everything is rosy. The sun shines on our every decision and the money rolls in. When we’re fit, we’re really fit and hit the gym 5 times a week. We eat well, sleep well and make time for ourselves while we balance our relationships carefully but make it all work.</p><p name="5e5e" id="5e5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then something goes wrong.</p><p name="66e9" id="66e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re never prepared for something to go wrong because we’re not programmed to think about things going wrong. We’re programmed to move fast, move forward and expect our best-laid plans to never go awry.</p><p name="30dd" id="30dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many years ago, my partner and imagined our own worst-case scenario and planned a fallback that we keep in our back pocket just in case things go belly up. Here’s what it looks like for us:</p><p name="8709" id="8709" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The scenario:</strong> My business folds and she loses her job. We have no savings and we have no consistent source of income with no immediate plans that lead us to long term success or stability.</p><p name="bd3e" id="bd3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The fallback: </strong>We have both agreed that if this situation comes about we will move to a small coastal town and both get jobs waiting on people, working in an office or doing something to cover our basic living expenses for a year.</p><p name="241c" id="241c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once we both realised that we were happy with our worst-case scenario and subsequent fallback options, the pressure we felt completely dissipated. </p><p name="da2f" id="da2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We started to save up a slush fund because that was the main issue we believed was causing us the most mental anguish. Instead of avoiding possibly failure, we chose to embrace the worst-case as a realistic possibility but never something that we actively worried about every day. We were able to stop worrying about the potential for failure because we had looked into the eye of the monster and realised that if we had a plan, things would be OK. </p><p name="9e22" id="9e22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few lessons that I learned from simply verbalising our worst-case scenario: </p><h4 name="bd6c" id="bd6c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">1. It’s probably not as bad as you think it could be. </strong></h4><p name="bd36" id="bd36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When you don’t verbalise your fears and concerns and you let them live in your mind, they can scale to the size of your imagination. Once you verbalise your fears you label them and keep them a rational size. Talk to your partner and family about what is going on in your mind and the fears you harbour. </p><h4 name="83cf" id="83cf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">2. Smart people have the never-ending potential to earn money. </strong></h4><p name="fa3d" id="fa3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A friend of mine, Craig Rodney, once told me and a few other smart friends of mine that people like us, smart people who are willing to work hard, have the never-ending potential to earn money. When Craig said those words I immediately understood what he meant; everything will be OK if you use your brain and are willing to work hard to get back on your feet. </p><h4 name="eba2" id="eba2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">3. Fail to plan and you plan to fail. </h4><p name="1b00" id="1b00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Humans, by nature, like to believe that everything is going to work out in the end. This, unfortunately, is just not true. You are going to fail. You are going to lose money, people around you are going to die and things are going to get rough at some point. Denying this is ignorant. If you ignore that there is a very likely chance that you could fail then when you do fail you will be completely gutted. Have a plan and ensure that it’s in place for the worst-case scenario. </p><p name="76f3" id="76f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see the same situation time and again with startups. Founders who believe that their product will always sell out. Who believe that users will pay them insane amounts of money premium features. Who believe that their investors will continue to plough money into their company just because they always have. Who believe that their staff will never leave despite treating them badly and paying them a pittance. The founders inevitably trip up and when they do it’s a devastating blow to their business, ego and personal lives. These founders rarely recover from these blows because they never believed they could fail. </p><p name="9538" id="9538" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As founders, we must always plan for the best case and work towards the best version of our businesses. No investor wants to see you planning for the worst-case. When you are building a company and trying to gain traction it’s impossible to talk about negative growth, slow registration figures, downward trending revenue graphs and financial losses. This immense hunger for fame, success and world domination is not for everyone. There is a certain type of person who can cope with the pressure of global ambition yet for some reason, we all believe that our businesses will be the next Facebook or Amazon and that our personal lives will look like Kim and Kanye’s. </p><p name="94e3" id="94e3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
