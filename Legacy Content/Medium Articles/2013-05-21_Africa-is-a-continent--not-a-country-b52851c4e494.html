For the uninformed Cape Town is a little bit Europe at the tip of Africa.</p><figure name="92ca" id="92ca" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*2iMkkomPiRAgOgEx.jpeg" data-width="1000" data-height="346" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2iMkkomPiRAgOgEx.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Table Mountain, Cape Town citybowl and the ocean to the left.</figcaption></figure><p name="0c6c" id="0c6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are Ferarri’s in the street, there is Moët in champagne glasses and there is wealth in some places. A lot of it. But there is also poverty. There is more poverty and struggle than there is wealth by a long way. But I don’t live in that Cape Town.</p><p name="204e" id="204e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a sneaking suspicion that many technology entrepreneurs don’t live in the world of the problems they are trying solving. This is a problem in and of itself.</p><p name="3ada" id="3ada" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easy to think that because I live in Africa that I actually live IN Africa. I sold that company and exited the business and was able to gain a bit of perspective. I put myself back into the <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/6446868d77a6" data-href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/6446868d77a6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Forefront of Incompetence</a> and realised that my understanding and skill was somewhat limited compared to what I had originally sold as my area of expertise. This scared me quite a bit and I realised that I had been treating Africa like a country, not the diverse continent that it is. And to make matters worse I was treating Africa like Cape Town.</p><p name="97ea" id="97ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a deadly mistake to make for any startup aiming at the African continent. That statement; The African continent, is probably going to end many businesses before they even start.</p><p name="b5c2" id="b5c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Here’s my tiny bit of advice from my tiny bit of traveling over the past 18 months into Africa; Africa is a place where there are many different countries, hundreds of different languages, tribes, colours, creeds, skills and ideas. Do not, at any point in time assume that one size fits all. It doesn’t.</p></div></div></section>
