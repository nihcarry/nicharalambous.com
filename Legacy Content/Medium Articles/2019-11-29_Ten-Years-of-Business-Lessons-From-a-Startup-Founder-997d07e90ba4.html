There are real, brutal lessons to learn at every turn.</p><p name="ac7f" id="ac7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I have failed more than I’d care to remember but the past decade has been an incredible ride. I have learned many things but below are some of the most important business lessons that I have learned.</p></div></div></section><section name="dcbd" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="69d6" id="69d6" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Raising money is not hard</h3><p name="b510" id="b510" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have spent so many coffee meetings talking to entrepreneurs who believe the world doesn’t understand them and their amazing idea or business. I’ve heard about fundraising difficulties in every format, industry, vertical and market. I mostly hear about fundraising difficulties from founders who should be struggling to raise money because money isn’t free.</p><p name="91c2" id="91c2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“VCs are idiots.”</p><p name="23c0" id="23c0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Money is dumb.”</p><p name="93f7" id="93f7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have to move countries to raise funding.”</p><p name="727d" id="727d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My startup is worth more than this offer.”</p><p name="d17e" id="d17e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are typical statements from startup founders.</p><p name="51e8" id="51e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the hard-hitting truth: If you can’t raise money, it’s probably your fault, not the investor’s.</p><p name="ea47" id="ea47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reasons that you’re struggling may include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="06e4" id="06e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">You have no traction.</li><li name="2cc2" id="2cc2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You have no revenue.</li><li name="dd09" id="dd09" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You have no track record as a founder (this is a tough one).</li><li name="0bfd" id="0bfd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You are lacking a good network to provide warm introductions to investors.</li><li name="c7c5" id="c7c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your idea is bad.</li><li name="d52b" id="d52b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your execution of the idea is bad.</li><li name="9e18" id="9e18" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your market is too small.</li></ul><p name="35c7" id="35c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Money is not hard to raise. Good partners are hard to find. The right partners are hard to find. But raising money, any kind of money, is not hard.</p><p name="06bb" id="06bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Building a business is difficult. You do not deserve funding. Investors don’t owe you anything. You need to prove that your business is worth investing in and if you do that, money is not hard to raise.</p><p name="4281" id="4281" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a parting note; my last few businesses have taught me that more than raising funding, founders should be improving sales. Selling is the best kind of funding. If you can’t sell your product and generate revenue then you shouldn&#39;t be able to go out and raise funding either.</p><h3 name="5477" id="5477" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Finding a partner is incredibly difficult</h3><p name="e9bd" id="e9bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Often a business partner is someone you know already. Perhaps from childhood, school, university or a colleague. You fall into this relationship out of convenience, comfort, and safety. You likely did not specifically seek them out, interview them and then decide to build something together. You just knew them and that they were right for you at the time.</p><p name="0531" id="0531" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have never met a business founder who doesn’t have a difficult, often gut-wrenching cofounder story to tell.</p><p name="391f" id="391f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This relationship is often overlooked as one of the most important in your life. You will spend more time with this person than with anyone else. At a startup, you work very hard and for very long hours in high-pressure situations that can blow up at any time. You will engage with your cofounder more than your partner, kids, family or best friends. You better fucking like them! And if you don’t like them, you better respect the hell out of them because you are going to become them and they will become you.</p><p name="6a62" id="6a62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is with a heavy heart that I can confidently tell you that at least one of your business partnerships is going to get messy. It’s inevitable. There are precious few cofounder relationships that don’t end in someone losing out. History is littered with cofounders who are broke while their ex-partner cashes in.</p><p name="bcf4" id="bcf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Choose your next business partner very, very carefully.</p><p name="84be" id="84be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that said, building a business alone is more difficult than building one with someone else. So take your time and get to know people before you jump into a startup with them.</p><h3 name="c267" id="c267" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Perseverance and resilience are everything</h3><p name="9090" id="9090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s something that very few bright-eyed, aspiring startup founders understand or believe: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You are going to fail.</strong></p><p name="3980" id="3980" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re going to fail every day and at every turn. Most of your failures will be manageable and small so you’ll be able to withstand them. Building a business is going to be difficult. Long periods of consistent fun are hard to find when you’re building something new on the cutting edge.</p><p name="beaa" id="beaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There will be months and maybe even years where at the end of the period you’ll feel like it was mostly good. And that’s amazing. There may even be periods where you thrive on the excitement and things feel amazing. I am sure that in those periods you will just have adjusted to the hardships of startup life.</p><p name="0f5d" id="0f5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key skill that I realized I needed to refine was perseverance. You can’t be a “one and done” kind of person to be a successful entrepreneur.</p><p name="840c" id="840c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have to an “onto the next one” kind of person. You hit a wall, bash through it, climb over it or walk around before you figure out that there actually was no wall to begin with and then you hit the next wall and do it all over again.</p><p name="20b4" id="20b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key is to do it all over again. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Do-Fail-Learn-Repeat-Businesses-ebook/dp/B07DVNX5L2/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1574952380&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANicholas+Haralambous&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=Nicholas+Haralambous" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Do-Fail-Learn-Repeat-Businesses-ebook/dp/B07DVNX5L2/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1574952380&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANicholas+Haralambous&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=Nicholas+Haralambous" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DO. FAIL. LEARN. REPEAT.</a> This is my business mantra. As Dory would say: “Just keep swimming”.</p><p name="edb7" id="edb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also realized that people love to say “no” to startup founders doing crazy and new things. You’re going to hear the word “no” more at a startup than you ever thought possible. When I was building a mobile internet startup almost ten years ago, I went out to raise a second round of funding. I met with nearly 40 different investors in six different countries and guess what? They all said no. Every single one. But I pushed on continued to build.</p><p name="fd80" id="fd80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a single “no” can knock you off your feet and send you spinning then you’re in trouble. If it’s important, it’s meant to be difficult. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it.</p><figure name="4ce8" id="4ce8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hhDaNbJyJ7z0jgW4lM_ZTA.jpeg" data-width="2268" data-height="3024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hhDaNbJyJ7z0jgW4lM_ZTA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nickdepartee?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@nickdepartee?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nick de Partee</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="869f" id="869f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Luck and timing are real variables</h3><p name="aec5" id="aec5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When I was at university I built a social network for students in digs. It launched shortly after Facebook launched. It was an unabridged failure. There are many variables at play when something succeeds or fails but two that are undeniable are timing and luck.</p><p name="574a" id="574a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You don’t really have control over either of them but you can use both to your advantage if you are experienced and aware of the world around you.</p><p name="66f5" id="66f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Practice is a key component of improving your <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">luck</strong>. The harder you work, the luckier you get. The golfer, Jerry Barber coined that phrase and I think it’s true. There is no such thing as a shower moment for someone who is not an expert in their field. That’s not the kind of luck that exists to me.</p><p name="2924" id="2924" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you spend ten years refining your skills, working hard and practicing it is possible that you will one day hit the jackpot while taking a shower. Only with dedicated work and consistent practice will you “stumble” on a solution to a problem that you’ve been contemplating for a year. This is the kind of luck you can control. You put yourself in a position, through hard work, where luck matters.</p><p name="10c1" id="10c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Timing</strong> is an entirely different kind of variable that can make or break your business and brain. Launch a year too early and you miss a trend. A year too late and the trend has missed you.</p><p name="4427" id="4427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a firm believer in “done” being better than “perfect” for this reason. You can capitalize on a trend with a product that is out in the market whether it is perfect or not. You can iterate and make the most of your luck and the timing available to you.</p><p name="03c2" id="03c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tied into this is the ability to look up and recognize shifting macro trends in the world. While building Nic Harry (a sock company I used to own) we started aggressively opening physical stores while the world was experiencing what we now call the “retail apocalypse”. Stores and malls across the world were closing while I was opening a new store every 3 months. Insanity that could have been avoided if I had just taken a month to breathe, look up and research the world I was living in.</p><h3 name="7905" id="7905" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cash flow vs Revenue vs Profit</h3><p name="6c29" id="6c29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Over the past decade, I have explained this simple concept to so many entrepreneurs that I feel like I should tattoo the phrase to my forehead:</p><blockquote name="481b" id="481b" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Cash flow vs revenue vs profit: Ask me about it!”</blockquote><p name="e4ee" id="e4ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Believe it or not, your business can be bringing in massive revenues and go under the next month. If you are reading this and wondering how then you don’t understand what cash flow is.</p><p name="b99c" id="b99c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The simple version: Money going out of your business (expenses) VS money coming into your business (revenue). If the expenses are due sooner than the revenue is coming into your account, you are screwed.</p><p name="8be7" id="8be7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your revenue is high, expenses are low and the money lands in your account often but leaves infrequently then you have time and cash flow to keep your business afloat. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">flow of cash</strong> is an incredibly important and potent concept that most entrepreneurs just don’t grasp effectively.</p><p name="879c" id="879c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not enough businesses aim to be profitable consistently. This is the holy grail for a business owner if you haven’t realized it yet.</p><p name="65e6" id="65e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you can build a business that consistently has more money coming in than going out you are profitable and sustainable. That’s the dream!</p><h3 name="6309" id="6309" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Hiring is more important than you think it is</h3><p name="4a6d" id="4a6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We all talk about how important hiring is but when you are scaling a business you just need bums in seats doing work. Often you bend on your criteria when you’re in a rush and up bringing in a sub-par team member.</p><p name="51f0" id="51f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take it from me; the bad eggs rot from the inside out and the rot spreads faster than you can manage it.</p><p name="4a30" id="4a30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hire slowly. Fire quickly.</strong></p><p name="0a8f" id="0a8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you are just starting to build your team, remember that you will become the five people you spend the most time with. Even darker, I believe that you will inherit the worst parts of the five people you spend the most time with. Make sure that their worst parts are better than the best of anyone else.</p><p name="d1fd" id="d1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These first five hires will also very clearly define your company culture. Don’t underestimate how important this is.</p><p name="704a" id="704a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the most important lessons I have learned around hiring and firing is that sometimes your best performing team members are assholes.</p><p name="9516" id="9516" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have to fire the assholes immediately.</p><p name="d262" id="d262" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One person can destroy your culture far more detrimentally than the work they do or the money they bring in.</p><p name="3394" id="3394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remember: Hire slowly. Fire quickly.</p><h3 name="be8f" id="be8f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">It’s OK to walk away</h3><p name="be75" id="be75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When you start building something it’s usually because the business is important to you. You are trying to solve a real problem that matters in the world or your world at the very least. This emotional commitment to your idea or business is a silent happiness killer.</p><p name="543c" id="543c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We marry our ideas but we forget that half of marriages end in divorce.</p><p name="30c7" id="30c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t marry your business or idea. There are lots of businesses to be built and lots of ideas in your head. There is a lot of time for you to start something new.</p><p name="81ea" id="81ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your business makes you unhappy, if you hate going to work every day, if you can’t get up in the morning, if you are unhealthy, fat, tired, drained, fearful, stressed out and suffer from panic attacks, do yourself a favor and consider walking the fuck away.</p><p name="bea5" id="bea5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may be embarrassed for a short time. You may feel depressed and sad but I can tell you now that you’ll get over it. You’re an entrepreneur and we are survivors, builders, thinkers, and opportunists. We make it through.</p><p name="b663" id="b663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No one ever tells us it’s OK to walk away so I’m telling you right now; <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It’s OK to walk away and burn it all down if you have to</strong>.</p><h3 name="0f4e" id="0f4e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Failing is integral to succeeding</h3><p name="5c58" id="5c58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have never met a successful person who has never failed. The smartest people I know embrace failure, they seek it out and work towards it as a goal. They aren’t shy about making mistakes.</p><p name="02ee" id="02ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The moment I decided to talk openly about failure I realized that everyone I know wants to talk about it too. We’re all neck-deep in <a href="https://medium.com/@nicharry/i-feel-like-a-fraud-5ae1ebb1304d" data-href="https://medium.com/@nicharry/i-feel-like-a-fraud-5ae1ebb1304d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">imposter syndrome</a> trying to feel OK about ourselves and our failures.</p><p name="709d" id="709d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more frequently we engage in conversations about our failures, the more we’ll all learn from them and accept them as normal. If you hide your failure and try to protect yourself from it you never become battle-ready and resilient.</p><p name="ea91" id="ea91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more you fail, the better you get at recognizing when you’re on the cusp of failing. As soon as you see the signs you can pivot, bob and weave and try something new. If you spend your days trying to avoid failure then the impending failures will just get bigger and bigger until one of them crushes you.</p><p name="5ae8" id="5ae8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Failure will eventually catch up with you and hurt your business. It’s just a part of building stuff. The first lightbulb wasn’t the one that we use today. The first social network didn’t live forever (and I doubt FACEBOOK will either).</p><p name="c3d5" id="c3d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lots of little failures are manageable, aim for them, seek them out, recognize them and kick them in the ass!</p><figure name="b0b4" id="b0b4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Wbb8NxbZgqwGAHvviyKozg.jpeg" data-width="3456" data-height="2304" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wbb8NxbZgqwGAHvviyKozg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alinnnaaaa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@alinnnaaaa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alina Grubnyak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/network?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/network?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="77b1" id="77b1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Your network defines you</h3><p name="fc0c" id="fc0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Relationships are really difficult to build and maintain. Most people have a core group of people and are set for life. This has been true for my immediate network of people that I rely on day to day but isn’t true of my broader network of people that I trust and that trust me.</p><p name="d776" id="d776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a 50/50 kind of guy. 50% of people really like and trust me and I have a feeling that 50% of the people I have met dislike me immensely and probably wouldn’t work with me if they had the choice.</p><p name="65d1" id="65d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like these odds. I don’t live to placate the people around me. I don’t live to make everyone happy. But I do respect people even if I don’t like them and I hope that people who encounter me respect me because I tell it like it is.</p><p name="83e8" id="83e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Early on in my life, I realized how important making and retaining relationships would be. I may not be the best friend to everyone but I have always stood by my way of life and am consistently the same person with everyone.</p><p name="3a74" id="3a74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I don’t like you, you know it. If I respect you, you know it. If you do something I don’t appreciate, we’ll have a conversation about it. This is how I maintain my network; I’m honest and I am who I am.</p><p name="8687" id="8687" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I take very seriously who I choose to spend time with. Time is literally the only asset that we cannot make more of so I am extremely careful with who I spend my time with. This is why I curate my network so carefully.</p><p name="8f90" id="8f90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and engage with them to figure out if we can help one another. But I don’t abuse my network of friends and colleagues. I nurture it, I add value, I provide an ear when they want to talk and connect people that I think can and will do amazing things together.</p><p name="81d1" id="81d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As my network has grown I receive requests for introductions. I once read about a double-opt-in introduction rule; you can only introduce people if both parties agree to the introduction. This is now my default rule. There is nothing worse than forcing a friend who trusts you to engage in a useless connection that you haven’t vetted properly and isn’t beneficial to both parties. Give the parties the ability to say no without any awkwardness.</p><p name="a5f0" id="a5f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Growing and maintaining a wider and more important network of people is a difficult task and requires dedicated attention. Don’t neglect it and then expect help one day. You have to nurture and grow with and for the people around you. Add value and then ask for help when you need it.</p><h3 name="9077" id="9077" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Sleep can make or break you</h3><p name="fe79" id="fe79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The older I get the more I want to ensure my sleeping routine is right for me. Early in my entrepreneurial journey, I worked through sleep cycles and ignored the damage that sleep deficit was doing to me.</p><p name="ca11" id="ca11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Staying awake until 3am and coding, writing a business plan, hustling, grinding and pushing through the wall of doubt is destructive and frankly very naive.</p><p name="76ac" id="76ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are dumb enough to think that you are special and can survive on 3 or 4 hours of sleep then that’s your choice. I am not that person. I like to wake up fresh and well-rested.</p><p name="9148" id="9148" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll probably ignore me on this one but remember reading these words in ten years when you’re exhausted and realize that you actually do need 8 hours of sleep.</p><p name="d974" id="d974" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are interested in figuring out how much sleep your body needs to survive then try this:</p><p name="e82e" id="e82e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Go to sleep relatively early for a week, around 9pm and don’t set an alarm. Make a note of the time you wake up naturally. Do this for 7 days and you will figure out your body&#39;s natural requirement for sleep. My minimum is 7 hours and max is 9. If I sleep for more than 9 hours I am a mess.</p><p name="b35d" id="b35d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are some simple tricks I’ve learned to help me with my sleep:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="65b7" id="65b7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Meditate in the morning or the evening. It teaches you to calm your mind.</li><li name="5f53" id="5f53" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don’t look at your phone before you go to bed.</li><li name="c5bb" id="c5bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don’t watch TV in bed (duh).</li><li name="a9f0" id="a9f0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Try to watch less TV overall.</li><li name="9e7c" id="9e7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Exercise.</li><li name="6b7b" id="6b7b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don’t check your email (duh).</li><li name="f6b2" id="f6b2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Turn off all notifications 30 mins before bedtime.</li><li name="e74e" id="e74e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If you can’t sleep because your mind is racing: Count your breaths to ten and then start over until you fall asleep (there are lots of this kind of trick).</li></ul><h3 name="e80c" id="e80c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Mental health matters</h3><p name="f847" id="f847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I spent my early twenties ignoring my mental health.</p><p name="b1e1" id="b1e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ignored the physical manifestations of my severe mental tension, stress, anxiety, panic, imposter syndrome and fear.</p><p name="6fb8" id="6fb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ignored it when it gave me a stomach ulcer. I ignored it when it ruined my relationships. I ignored it when it sank my businesses. I ignored it because the world told me that men don’t have mental health issues, they are strong and it’s not manly to admit you need some help and mental coaching. I ignored my mental health until my mind broke.</p><p name="766c" id="766c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, I saw a psychologist and took my mental health seriously and I have never looked back.</p><p name="859a" id="859a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I meditate multiple times a week and whenever I can, I talk to people about how I’m doing and how they are doing. I talk openly about mental health being as important as physical health.</p><p name="7b48" id="7b48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learn from my pain; take your mental health seriously and if you feel like anxiety and stress are overwhelming you then talk to someone.</p><h3 name="6599" id="6599" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">None of it means as much as you think it does</h3><p name="eca9" id="eca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You think that your social media widget thingy is the most important thing in the world when you’re building it. The truth is, none of it really matters that much. Yes, it’s good to be passionate about what you do and yes your business is important to you at the time you’re building it, but it’s likely going to fail and you’re likely not going to die when it does.</p><p name="a2a1" id="a2a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If it literally isn’t going to kill you, it isn’t the most important thing.</strong></p><p name="c118" id="c118" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You think that you need to answer that email at 10pm. You don’t.</p><p name="23f5" id="23f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You think that you need to wake up and get straight to work without exercise or meditation. You don’t.</p><p name="9bdc" id="9bdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You think that if you don’t make this business work your life will be over. It won&#39;t.</p><p name="88ab" id="88ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your business is going to fail, trust me. It’s going to happen.</p><p name="eac8" id="eac8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know what happens tomorrow if your business fails today? Not a whole lot. You may have debt and that sucks, but you can work your way out of it. You may have some pissed off staff or suppliers, but they’ll get over it.</p><p name="027f" id="027f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Something only matters as much as you give it relevance and weight.</strong></p><p name="35f0" id="35f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can choose a different reaction. You can choose a different feeling. You can integrate your work with your life and vice versa. It’s not a zero-sum game.</p><p name="eaac" id="eaac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest lesson that I’ve learned as a startup founder and entrepreneur is this:</p><h4 name="f365" id="f365" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing">Life is not a zero-sum game and nor is business.</h4></div></div></section><section name="452d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="cfc3" id="cfc3" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading graf--trailing">If you liked this article, you’ll freakin’ love my newsletter, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" data-href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up now</a>!</h4></div></div></section>
