The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to work from home, the mass resignation, the anxiety and stress of social media addiction and the need to earn a living and live your best life have all made existence complex and difficult. </p><p name="cb42" id="cb42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard to be happy. It’s almost as if the world doesn’t want us to be happy. For many employees, that’s absolutely how they feel about their employer. There are hints everywhere that business leaders don’t really care about the happiness of their teams. Why should they? The role of a business is to provide work and pay people to do that work. The role of a business leader is to make sure that everybody gets their work don&#39;t, hits deadlines, falls in line and gets shit done, right? That’s how it feels for a lot of people. That’s how a lot of managers and business leaders act. That’s how most corporate policies understand the relationship between employer and employee; transactional and one-sided. </p><p name="e897" id="e897" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happiness is for home life, not work life. </p><p name="3ee9" id="3ee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happiness is yours to figure out, not your manager or CEO. </p><p name="da67" id="da67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happiness is immaterial to the bottom line of a business. </p><p name="9cd0" id="9cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, there are leaders who genuinely care about the happiness of their team and of course, there are managers who don’t realise they are punishing their employees but nevertheless continue to do so. </p><p name="4813" id="4813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every time a manager calls someone in their team at 11pm on a Thursday night, they are choosing to ignore that person’s happiness. Every time a colleague sends an email to his team at 2am, he is choosing to ignore those people’s happiness. Every time a business leader takes on more work than there are people to do that work, she is not choosing to prioritise her team’s happiness. Every time a leader makes someone work over the weekend, they are choosing to ignore that person’s happiness. Whenever leaders humble-brag about how many hours they work, how hard they grind, how little sleep they get, how much work they can do, they are choosing to ignore happiness. </p><p name="9aa2" id="9aa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the thing, happiness is actually an indication of job success and ultimately business success and profitability. </p><p name="55b0" id="55b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The latest research shows that happier employees:<br>• Are more likely to emerge as leaders<br>• Earn higher scores on performance evaluations<br>• Tend to be better teammates<br>• Are healthier<br>• Have lower rates of absenteeism<br>• Are highly motivated to succeed<br>• Are more creative<br>• Have better relationships with peers<br>• Are less likely to leave a company</p><p name="aa61" id="aa61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are a lot of unhappy people working in unhappy businesses for unhappy leaders. I know because I’ve been an unhappy leader.<br>I know because I’ve built unhappy businesses.<br>I know because I’ve worked with unhappy cofounders.</p><p name="b862" id="b862" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At one startup, I worked with a CEO who clearly didn’t care about team happiness at all. Work was work and happiness was found elsewhere.</p><p name="c0dd" id="c0dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Month after month I’d recruit top talent and week after week people would abandon ship. Burned out, mentally exhausted, physically unhealthy and driven to the brink of insanity by a leader with no boundaries, no focus and no care for his team.</p><p name="48f1" id="48f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you think that work and life are separate, you’re wrong.<br>If you think you can be unhappy at work but happy in life, you’re wrong.</p><p name="0024" id="0024" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Sacrifice Fallacy</p><p name="b9f8" id="b9f8" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
