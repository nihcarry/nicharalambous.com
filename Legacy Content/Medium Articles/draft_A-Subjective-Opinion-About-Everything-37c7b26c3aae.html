Below are the ten guidelines that I try to live by as often as possible. Sometimes they change and I update the list below. Sometimes I fail dismally at trying to maintain a perfect record. Life is not about being perfect, I suppose.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="eab1" id="eab1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">There is nothing after this</li><li name="ac34" id="ac34" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Learn the rules but ignore them</li><li name="00aa" id="00aa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Be honest if possible</li><li name="c769" id="c769" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do more</li><li name="9060" id="9060" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Waiting is an action</li><li name="594b" id="594b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Trust people until you have a reason not to</li><li name="5d10" id="5d10" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Listen more, talk less</li><li name="09c4" id="09c4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Everything is easier without ego</li><li name="f1a9" id="f1a9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Burn it all down if you have to</li><li name="f9fd" id="f9fd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Strong opinions loosely held</li></ol><p name="6af4" id="6af4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The above statements encompass my world view. These are the guiding principles behind my life and the decisions I make every day. This is how I live.</p><h3 name="6331" id="6331" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">There is nothing after this</h3><p name="69a3" id="69a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I do not believe in an afterlife. Everything that we understand with science and facts indicates that the life we are given, the ±80 years on this tiny rock, is the only life that we will live. No one has ever come back from the dead and shown us what an afterlife is. I hold this concept to be true in my world view. There is nothing else. This is it. If this is it, what the fuck are you doing with your one shot?</p><h3 name="5772" id="5772" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Learn the rules but ignore them</h3><p name="f9ec" id="f9ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">From a very young age I understood that the system I exist within (society, gravity, science, community, etc) can be manipulated to my advantage. The way that I have done this throughout my life is to learn the rules, have a deep understanding of them and then ignore them completely. Other people stick to the rules. Other people play by the rules. In fact, other people made the rules. The rules that guide your life are made up by other idiots like you. They are not special, they don’t have an extra brain or fifth appendage that helps them write more down than you do. These rules are human by design and can be (should be) broken by humans.</p><h3 name="44b4" id="44b4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Be honest if possible</h3><p name="ed9d" id="ed9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I don’t like to lie but I believe that a well intentioned lie is sometimes better than a damaging truth. It’s best to be honest if being honest is possible but honesty is not always the most fair and justifiable route to take.</p><h3 name="f411" id="f411" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Do more</h3><p name="3bf0" id="3bf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">These two words define my life more than any other two words have or likely ever will.</p><p name="ed48" id="ed48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am constantly trying to fill my day with more things. I think most people think that finishing a tv series is something they have done this week. It’s not. Don’t get me wrong, I like watching tv, but I know it’s not an accomplishment. I believe that this is the only shot I get at living life so I want to do as much as I can justify fitting in.</p><h3 name="b03f" id="b03f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Waiting is an action</h3><p name="f0a9" id="f0a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By nature I am an impatient person. I’d argue this is probably the single biggest area of my life that I try to work on the most. My psychologist once said to me that waiting is an action.</p><p name="75a0" id="75a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Waiting is an action.</p><p name="854f" id="854f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had previously considered waiting to be passive. Something I need to suffer through to get to the next action. This one statement completely reframed the way I do everything. If you have implemented your plan effectively then it’s OK to wait and see what happens. Waiting is an action.</p><h3 name="e108" id="e108" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Trust people until you have a reason not to</h3><p name="87b5" id="87b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">People are the worst. People are also some of the best parts of being alive. I’ve been hurt by my fair share of human beings but if I look back I have to admit that the hurt was likely avoidable if I was paying attention.</p><p name="e70e" id="e70e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People are not as smart as they like to think they are. The people around me are constantly telling me how they feel with their actions (and sometimes their words) but sometimes I miss the signals.</p><p name="1658" id="1658" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After enough hurtful encounters I decided that you can’t live in the world without trusting people but that trust is fragile. Break it and it shatters into a trillion little pieces that can very rarely be put back together. When someone breaks your trust with intent it is unlikely that they will ever change or you will ever recover.</p><h3 name="202d" id="202d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Listen more, talk less</h3><p name="d1fd" id="d1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I am a talker. I enjoy debating with my friends (or anyone if I’m honest) but I can often come across as a know it all, aggressive, condescending asshole. I work extremely hard to listen with intent, to not plan my next statement while you are finishing off yours and to actively engage in conversations where I am not the expert. It’s incredible what you can learn when you listen more and talk less.</p><h3 name="9076" id="9076" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Everything is easier without ego</h3><p name="abbb" id="abbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Learning to apologise is one of the most important skills I have acquired over the past decade. A sincere, meaningful apology is a sign that your ego is in check. Out of control ego is one of the least attractive qualities in a human. I can’t stand working with people who have an inflated ego. I can’t stand talking to people with an inflated ego. I can barely manage being around myself when I let my own ego get the better of me. It’s an ugly look to wear your ego for everyone to see.</p><p name="f07a" id="f07a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The smartest, most accomplished people I know have a nuanced understanding of their ego and their ability to reign it in and release at relevant times. In my experience, everything I do is easier without ego.</p><h3 name="cb2c" id="cb2c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Burn it all down if you have to</h3><p name="059d" id="059d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In economics, a sunk cost is any past cost that has already been paid and cannot be recovered. Sticking with something because you have already invested in it is called the Sunk Cost Fallacy. It’s rife in society today. We hang on to things because we spent time or money acquiring them and investing in them so we never let them go.</p><p name="b144" id="b144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe in the Burn It Down approach to life. If you have a pair of leather pants that you spent a $1000 to purchase but you never wear them because you are scared of what people might say, just throw them out or sell them. Are you with someone because you’ve been with them for 10 years so you think it’s easier to stay even though you are unhappy? Do you have a business that earns you decent money but doesn’t make you happy?</p><p name="6568" id="6568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Burn it all down. Throw it all out. Sometimes the best way to move forward is through the flames of your past.</p><h3 name="13f5" id="13f5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Strong opinions loosely held</h3><p name="5a94" id="5a94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I believe strongly in the things that I choose to believe in but I hold these beliefs up very loosely.</p><p name="226b" id="226b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the facts change, I am very comfortable changing my opinion or beliefs. It helps to minimise my ego and be honest if possible. If someone tells me that there is proof that god exists and that proof is as indisputable as gravity then I’d consider changing my opinion on the existence of a god. I have a strong opinion about most things but I am not dumb enough to think I know with absolute certainty that my beliefs are always going to be correct.</p><p name="5c8c" id="5c8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We once believed the universe revolved (literally) around the earth. Then we believed that the earth was flat, then we believed that Donald Trump would never become president. We’re full of strong opinions that are constantly disproved. The key to this for me is what is known as the burden of proof. If you believe that god exists the burden of proof sits with you. You need to prove to me that god exists. I can prove the gravity exists and that there are billions of planets in the universe. If you assert that the facts surrounding gravity are incorrect, the burden of proof sits with you. If you successfully disprove gravity in an indisputable manner, then I’m happy to switch my opinion.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="bba6" id="bba6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">friends</li><li name="78cc" id="78cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">family</li><li name="8a26" id="8a26" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">failure</li><li name="0857" id="0857" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">success</li><li name="17c5" id="17c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">ego</li><li name="542d" id="542d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">humans</li><li name="c878" id="c878" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">the earth</li><li name="59cd" id="59cd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">belief</li><li name="c14c" id="c14c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">nihilism</li><li name="84e0" id="84e0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">drugs</li><li name="369e" id="369e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">marriage / relationships</li><li name="d5a9" id="d5a9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">money</li><li name="0824" id="0824" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">country of birth / patriotism</li><li name="e7dc" id="e7dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">your job/passion/vocation</li><li name="ff41" id="ff41" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">owning stuff</li><li name="5e38" id="5e38" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">being curious</li><li name="46b5" id="46b5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">children</li><li name="933c" id="933c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">animals</li><li name="24fb" id="24fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Exercise</li><li name="7182" id="7182" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reading</li><li name="7d59" id="7d59" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fashion / clothing</li><li name="2802" id="2802" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Meditation</li><li name="8984" id="8984" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Anxiety and stress</li><li name="f299" id="f299" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sleep</li><li name="9237" id="9237" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social Media</li><li name="0d48" id="0d48" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sports</li><li name="9c78" id="9c78" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The universe</li><li name="b424" id="b424" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Music</li><li name="7470" id="7470" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Regrets</li><li name="abf2" id="abf2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Legacy</li><li name="866e" id="866e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Borders and passports</li></ol><p name="1010" id="1010" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--li"><br></p><p name="d3b7" id="d3b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Universe is in constant entropy and you are no different.
