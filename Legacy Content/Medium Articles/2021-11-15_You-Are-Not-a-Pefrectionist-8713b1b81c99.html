I’m tired of trying to have the perfect beard, the perfectly shaved head, the perfect outfit, the perfect spelling and grammar, the perfect relationship, the perfect idea, the perfect product, the perfect business, launch strategy, pr strategy, corporate culture and on and on and fucking on with the perfection.</p><p name="b3a7" id="b3a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s exhausting.</p><p name="e8d4" id="e8d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m exhausted.</p><p name="f767" id="f767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am also to blame.</p><p name="f3b2" id="f3b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tell myself that this article isn’t perfect… yet. My self-talk leans towards perfection all the time and I quietly berate myself if I am not pushing for perfection constantly.</p><p name="3125" id="3125" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s exhausting.</p><p name="e9b0" id="e9b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did I mention how exhausted I am from striving for perfection? No? Well, I’m exhausted and I am sure you are too.</p><p name="1148" id="1148" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So let’s get over it.</p><p name="99b6" id="99b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perfection is perlillous. It’s time for us to reframe our self-talk.</p><p name="9ce5" id="9ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hate hearing someone tell me that they are a perfectionist because my inner voice pushes back immediately with: “No you’re not.”</p><p name="062c" id="062c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are not a perfectionist and nor am I. If you are triggered reading that sentence, good. Get over your self-righteous self. Perfect sucks. Perfect means it’s over and there is nothing left to do and that’s boring. If you were a perfectionist you wouldn’t be able to leave the house because your clothes will never be perfectly aligned all the time. Your car will never be perfectly clean all the time. Your hair will never stay perfectly styled throughout the day. Your skin won’t remain blemish-free and perfect. Your approach to life is incomplete and imperfect but that’s where beauty lives.</p><p name="c919" id="c919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We use the idea of perfection as an excuse to avoid hard things. You think you have the best business idea but you don’t want to talk about it because it’s not perfect yet. You have the perfect video to push out to your community but you’re not ready to publish because it’s just not perfect yet. You want to release a podcast but you haven’t found the perfect guest to kick things off.</p><p name="3b8e" id="3b8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been coaching a lot of business owners and founders recently and this is one of the most infuriating excuses I come across from all kinds of talented people. Perfection is a roadblock we erect so that we can delay the potentially harmful public humiliation we are scared of.</p><p name="82f3" id="82f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And therein lies the flywheel of perfect destruction:</p><p name="0902" id="0902" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Have an idea</p><p name="77c4" id="77c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Work on said idea for a little bit and make some progress</p><p name="4ef0" id="4ef0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Sink enough time into the idea that you are protective of it</p><p name="0c10" id="0c10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Obsess over the nuances of said idea</p><p name="8394" id="8394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Refine, refine, refine, refine</p><p name="5925" id="5925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Delay launch and build up anticipation in your mind</p><p name="9c33" id="9c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Wait longer, refine more, create overwhelming anticipation</p><p name="24cc" id="24cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">→ Never launch</p><p name="c00b" id="c00b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so the cycle perpetuates because we are more obsessed with perfection than we are with feedback.</p><p name="9691" id="9691" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Replace your desire for perfection with a ruthless desire for constructive feedback and you will never delay launching something again.</p><p name="0a9c" id="0a9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was pioneered by Erik Ries in his book, The Lean Startup. The lean startup methodology and an MVP promotes the concept of launching. Launch your idea, product, service, thought, video, article or anything into the world quickly and iterate. Don’t spend years building something that nobody will want.</p><p name="1649" id="1649" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key concept here that I think has been overlooked over the years is that of data. You launch a minimum viable product so that you can receive constructive data from your customers and users. You are then able to use the data to gather insights about the product or idea they are testing for you so that you can iterate and create a better version of the idea, or, a more perfect version if you will.</p><p name="26f0" id="26f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your self-assigned label as a “perfectionist” is killing your soul, destroying your ideas and making you unbearable to be around.</p><p name="451b" id="451b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">YOU. ARE. NOT. A. PERFECTIONIST.</strong></p><p name="15ac" id="15ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you expect to iterate if you are too afraid to launch?</p><p name="175b" id="175b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How can you refine something that has never been used or tested out in the wild? Whether it’s an idea, a thought, an opinion, an outfit, a product, a service or anything else you can only test it and refine it if you launch it.</p><p name="3b96" id="3b96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Stop holding yourself back, stop calling yourself a perfectionist and just launch already.</p></div></div></section>
