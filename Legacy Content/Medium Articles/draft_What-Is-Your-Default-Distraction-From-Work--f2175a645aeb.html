My follower count isn’t growing, my audience engagement has bottomed out and I’m not really sure what to do about it. I’m tweeting into the wind but I am also not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just</em> tweeting. I also produce a podcast once a week. I send a newsletter once a week. I write a blog post once a week. I post on LinkedIn every single day. I host live streams twice a month answering business questions. I host a private monthly call for entrepreneurs building side hustles. I am active. </p><p name="7da0" id="7da0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first thing I know about content right now is that the world rewards polarization and strong opinions.</p><p name="fb94" id="fb94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second thing I know is that focus matters (you can’t tweet about business, politics, marketing, investing, bird watching, board games, clothing, pet care and everything in between). </p><p name="7fea" id="7fea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The third thing I thought I knew was that people wanted to engage with content and click on links. </p><p name="f78f" id="f78f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then Rich Mulholland and I were talking about this problem and I think we stumbled upon a concept that might help me (and hopefully you, too) unlock more value for my content generally. </p><p name="9e70" id="9e70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Answer a question for me: When you have 8 minutes between meetings, what do you do? What platform do you turn to? Which app do you open? Said another way: </p><p name="a966" id="a966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is your Default Distraction?</strong></p><p name="28a8" id="28a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you open up TikTok and swipe up past 30 or 40 fifteen second videos? Do you whip open the Reddit app and find your favourite subreddit and dive deeply into a single post? Do you read an article that you’ve had open for a week in a tab hidden amongst hundreds of opened and unread tabs? Do you scroll through Instagram stories or watch a useful 8 minute YouTube video?</p><p name="596d" id="596d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is your Default Distraction?</p><p name="af8d" id="af8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why does this even matter to me and my Twitter problem? Well, mostly because I think I’m fighting for people’s attention, right? Aren’t we all? And if I’m trying to fight for your attention on Twitter with a link to my latest podcast episode that is an hour-long, you’re probably not going to click it and start listening, are you? No. No, you’re not. You’re going to find your default distraction and pop through a few more TikToks/Reels/Stories/Snaps/YT Shorts/etc and then dive into your next meeting. </p><p name="76e8" id="76e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rich did something with his newsletter that I think is smart and could provide an answer to the default distraction issue. For a while he shared his newsletter with his favourite links from the week on a Saturday morning. </p><p name="a417" id="a417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The prevailing knowledge is that if you want to consistently engage an audience then you have to consistently post about a core theme as frequently as you can cope with and build a loyal following of people who read and share everything you do. Consistency is the play and focusing on a single core area of authority is the method. </p></div></div></section>
