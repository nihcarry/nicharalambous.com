I’ve said this before and I’ll likely be saying it for the rest of my life. At the best of times, building a new business and keeping an existing one afloat is very, very difficult.</p><p name="ef69" id="ef69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are people who will constantly tell you that this is not true. Investors, advisors, other “brave” entrepreneurs and many others will promise you that this is the time to grow and make it big. They will tell you that if you are a real entrepreneur you don’t experience or feel the hardships and pain and if you do feel it then you can and will most certainly find a way out because that’s what entrepreneurs do.</p><p name="632f" id="632f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Entrepreneurs find opportunity in strife. We see solutions where others see problems. We see profit when others see pain. We are glass half full kinds of people. These things are all true but they are not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always</em> true.</p><p name="9fe3" id="9fe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to address the microscopic elephant in the room, COVID-19.</p><p name="dd55" id="dd55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not an expert on the topic. I am, in fact, a medical moron. Do not listen to anything I have to say about the actual virus itself, please refer to the experts for proper information.</p><p name="ab45" id="ab45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pandemic is ripping through the world and the world media. It’s everywhere, literally and metaphorically. You can’t escape this little bastard. Visit Twitter, Insta, FB, TikTok, news outlets, podcasts, newsletters, radio stations, television and anywhere else and all you’ll get is COVID-19 updates and news.</p><p name="8ce2" id="8ce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I gave a keynote address at a conference in Johannesburg recently and the virus came up constantly. I also sat on a panel and one of the questions focused on the current small business climate in the face of the virus and other calamities around the world. I try to be honest when I answer this kind of question because the truth helps us prepare more effectively.</p><p name="5a98" id="5a98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the short version of my view on the current outlook for small businesses in South Africa and around the world: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It’s going to get really bad before it things begin to normalise.</strong></p><p name="317c" id="317c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the high-level situation that we are facing in South Africa right now:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e84f" id="e84f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Rolling blackouts across the country</li><li name="6cb6" id="6cb6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We have officially entered another economic recession</li><li name="fe2a" id="fe2a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Water shortages and droughts in many cities</li><li name="df10" id="df10" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Veld fires sweeping through Cape Town and other regions</li><li name="1571" id="1571" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">COVID-19 destroying tourism and restricting standard levels of spending that maintain our dire economy</li><li name="f2eb" id="f2eb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Political unrest and a failing ruling party</li><li name="0a13" id="0a13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Corrupt and bankrupt state-owned enterprises</li><li name="0f7c" id="0f7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Rampant crime and corruption throughout the nation</li></ul><p name="f1f8" id="f1f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It is in the nature of an entrepreneur to look for positives to justify our disposition as optimists. It helps us get up every day and keep going to find opportunity. One positive right now is that our President finally showed himself to be the kind of leader that our country needs by announcing measures to try and prevent the spread of the virus in South Africa.

For small businesses though, things have been getting more and more difficult over the past ten or so years in South Africa. Yes, of course, there is opportunity but there is also a lot of discomfort.</p><p name="c677" id="c677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some businesses are able to react quickly and move into the digital realm. Others will not be so lucky and this is the heartbreaking part for entrepreneurs. Many businesses are going to go under whether you make the hard choices right now or not.</p><p name="7d06" id="7d06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To help you plan, I have made a list of things that small business owners need to start doing right now to prepare for the rough six months ahead of us:</p><h4 name="f534" id="f534" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Know your finances intimately</h4><p name="7663" id="7663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Make sure that you understand your expenses and financial commitments.</p><p name="5a42" id="5a42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How much money do you have in the bank?</p><p name="2372" id="2372" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How much is leaving your bank account by the end of the month?</p><p name="1889" id="1889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How much is coming in?</p><p name="8072" id="8072" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can you get a discount on your office rent?</p><p name="342f" id="342f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What other expenses can you cut or mitigate?</p><h4 name="043c" id="043c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Assess your team</h4><p name="e317" id="e317" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is a tough one. Some of your team may need to be let go. Some of your team might need to work fewer hours. Some of your team may have to take salary cuts to keep their jobs.</p><p name="e7d5" id="e7d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Make the hard decisions quickly and work to implement the changes as soon as possible.</p><p name="aeb6" id="aeb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want your business to survive then the hard choices are the right ones, especially when it comes to people.</p><h4 name="bab4" id="bab4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Get back to basics</h4><p name="27e2" id="27e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Focus on the basics of your business. Don’t worry about your ten-year strategy right now. Make sure that your cashflow is managing. Make sure that you give the best customer service you can give. Ensure that your product delivery is amazing. Continue to win over your customers every day. Remember, they’re also having a difficult time and anything you can do to make it better will go a long way.</p><h4 name="a81c" id="a81c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Make the shift to digital</h4><p name="7577" id="7577" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Can your meetings take place online? If they can, do this immediately. Start showing the world that you are a leader in the pivot to digital business.</p><p name="f6a4" id="f6a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can your product or service work in a world that limits physical interactions? If not right now then how quickly can you make that happen?</p><p name="1f97" id="1f97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can you unlock a new market somewhere else using online methods? Think about every aspect of your work and your company and decide if it can move to a digital space.</p><h4 name="bd0f" id="bd0f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Sell, sell, sell</h4><p name="9328" id="9328" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Selling is an art and one that you need to master if you are an entrepreneur. Now, more than ever, you’re going to have to start selling as if your life and business depend on it because they do.</p><p name="4195" id="4195" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you aren’t reaching out for new business then you are behind the curve. Sure, people are going to be holding on to their money now more than ever before but that shouldn’t stop you from trying. At the very least you’ll gain new customers when the panic settles down and normalcy returns.</p><p name="a08d" id="a08d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s also a good idea to start diversifying your sales channels. Do you use Adwords, LinkedIn ads, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and other platforms to promote your business? No? Then get started.</p><p name="ace1" id="ace1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Start doing video sales calls to customers across the world.</p><p name="90a2" id="90a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do not depend on one customer. If they don’t pay you, you’re screwed.</p><h4 name="9df3" id="9df3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Don’t try to build new products</h4><p name="d076" id="d076" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">By the time you finish building new products, you’ll be dead in the water or the crisis will have calmed down.</p><p name="2c89" id="2c89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Focus on your existing products and even consider cutting down and focusing more. Pick your best performing product or service and double down on it. Gain more traction, eek more sales out and open up new markets. Unless you have products in the pipeline that are primed to launch you should not be looking at anything new for the next few months. Just hunker down, cut expenses and promote existing products and services.</p><h4 name="de57" id="de57" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Get paid</h4><p name="4204" id="4204" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Now is the time to get over your anxiety of debt collecting. Small businesses are always at risk with prolonged payment terms and big businesses who just pay slowly.</p><p name="0704" id="0704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right now you need to start calling anyone and everyone who owes you money. Get paid immediately. Don’t wait and don’t take no for an answer. Call in every bit of free cash you can because you are going to need it.</p><p name="554e" id="554e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Forget about the payment terms on the invoice, call the customer and ask if they can pay sooner or immediately.</p><p name="abed" id="abed" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">If</span> you prepare right now, starting today, there’s a chance that you can thrive in this climate. But if you wait you are going to suffer. Six months of bad sales will kill your business.</p><p name="b574" id="b574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s never fun to think about bad things and difficult times but building businesses isn’t always fun. You have to choose; do you want to be polite or do you want your business to survive?</p><p name="7b3a" id="7b3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I opt for survival every time.</p></div></div></section><section name="5d85" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="03c1" id="03c1" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Nic Haralambous is an obsessive entrepreneur and keynote speaker. </em></strong><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" data-href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Nic" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sign up</em></strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> for his newsletter or </em></strong><a href="https://www.twitter.com/nicharry" data-href="https://www.twitter.com/nicharry" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">follow him</em></strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on Twitter.</em></strong></p></div></div></section>
