It’s a big park with huge trees, lots of grass and an area for dogs to swim. My dogs obviously love this park. It’s generally pleasant there but sometimes I have other things to do and walking dogs starts to feel like a chore.</p><p name="7f26" id="7f26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me, as soon as something feels like a chore, I’m out. I mentally check out of the process and it takes everything in me to complete the task at hand. I hate, HATE, sweeping the floor. Even more than sweeping, I hate doing the dishes. These are chores and I do not like chores.</p><p name="54af" id="54af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While walking my dogs that day in the park, something happened that hadn’t happened there before. Someone took the initiative on a cold morning and set up a coffee and muffin stand. So, at 9am on a Saturday morning while feeling stubborn and irritated by the idea of walking my dogs, I ordered a coffee and a muffin and took a seat on a bench in the park. My dogs continue to run around like they had rabies and I had strangely sat back and embraced where I was and what I was doing.</p><p name="3234" id="3234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s the point?</p><p name="8833" id="8833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Simply put - my chore became an experience and therefore, something I <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">wanted</strong> to do.</p><p name="8f95" id="8f95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By spending a small amount of money, all of sudden the situation had completely shifted from something I was loathe to do, to something that I was thoroughly enjoying.</p><p name="2ae2" id="2ae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I realised, walking around the park with my warm cup of sanity in my hands that this is such a simple concept to apply to just about any process or business.</p><h3 name="d2a4" id="d2a4" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Creating An Experience</h3><p name="7348" id="7348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now, I’m not suggesting that every process should be accompanied by a cup of coffee or every sale should be delivered with a muffin (although, how cool would that be?).</p><p name="5441" id="5441" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I am suggesting is that simple things in your business can be turned into the metaphorical cup of coffee that turns a chore into an experience for your customers.</p><p name="977f" id="977f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine if sending a complaint about a faulty product was turned into an activity and not a chore. Or if the act of complaining actually ended up placing the customer in a better mood than when they started the process of complaining?</p><p name="456d" id="456d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s a cup of coffee right there.</p><p name="8727" id="8727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chore will then become an experience that your customers will talk about to their friends.</p><figure name="d514" id="d514" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GMnv4QVYZVCDNyBXtdyZdg.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="257" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GMnv4QVYZVCDNyBXtdyZdg.jpeg"></figure><p name="ceb0" id="ceb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Slack did this in a very smart way with their product quirks. While waiting for a screen to load you’re presented with quirky quote to entertain you. Waiting is usually a chore and I spend a fair portion of my day staring at animated gif icons of something spinning around something. Not with Slack.</p><p name="2ef7" id="2ef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are tiny opportunies to create experiences throughout your business. You need to look out for them and then commit to making the chore go away.</p><p name="2e36" id="2e36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The more your product or service feels like a chore, the more you’ll discover people react the way I do to chores.</p></div></div></section>
