Humanity is curious by nature. If we weren’t then I wouldn’t be standing on this stage talking to you right now. I’d be in a cave somewhere freezing my ass off just having come back from a likely failed attempt at hunting for food with no fire to keep me warm. Luckily, we’re a curious bunch.</p><p name="5a64" id="5a64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But somewhere along the line we become comfortable, complacent and stop engaging with the world around us. We lose our curiosity. This starts a slow decay of our own cohesive system.</p><p name="578f" id="578f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All around us are systems. Our bodies, families, friends, businesses, sports teams, cities, countries and on and on. Systems are integral to human existence and progress. Every system has clearly defined parts that help to keep it working and my observation and research indicates that curiosity is an absolutely integral part to the long-term success of any system.</p><p name="a7ef" id="a7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s go for a quick crash-course in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Systems Theory</strong>:</p><p name="47dd" id="47dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">SYSTEMS THEORY</strong></p><p name="778e" id="778e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Systems thinking focuses on how the individual that is being studied interacts with the other constituents of the system.</p><p name="4ab3" id="4ab3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each system requires varying parts to work together to continue to be effective. If one part changes dramatically without considering the others, then the system breaks. Start thinking about your company or department, your relationships and life in general, can you think about a part of the system that’s breaking things right now?? I bet you can.</p><p name="c514" id="c514" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Peter Senge is an incredibly smart systems scientist. He wrote extensively about organisations and coined the concept of the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Learning Organisation</strong> which is based on the idea of system thinking. A <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">learning organization</strong> is a company that facilitates the learning of its members and continuously transforms itself.</p><p name="12be" id="12be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Startups are learning organisations. Startups understand how to adapt, execute, learn, test, fail and then engage their flywheel and do it all over again until something sticks. Startups are obsessively curious learning organisations.</p><p name="4653" id="4653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Big businesses are mostly not learning organisations and have lost their innate curiosity. I believe that entrenched curiosity is the key to a learning organisation that thrives.</p><p name="abf1" id="abf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s what we’re here today to talk about: Startups and startup founders know how to stay hungry, stay curious and innovate. I have been building startups since I was 16 and I want to help more people understand what makes a startup tick.</p><p name="91e8" id="91e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Losing curiosity especially true in successful, old, big businesses. Startups start out hungry, curious and driven. They push the boundaries of real-life and create a future that was previously unimaginable. Then they become profitable and big and settle into a rhythm and routine. Think Mxit, Vodacom, Taxis, Hotels all being replaced my startups like WhatsApp, Airbnb and Uber.</p><p name="9a5e" id="9a5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tides change at some point, the decades move on and the trends shift away from their world-changing technology to something new, innovative and shiny. To the latest startups.</p><p name="2b9c" id="2b9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is one word that strikes fear and uncertainty into the minds of every great business and leader. That word is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“INNOVATING”</strong>. Innovation is a key part of a learning organisation and an integral part of a businesses system thinking.</p><p name="c467" id="c467" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">INNOVATION</strong></p><p name="001f" id="001f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This single word has baffled the best, bamboozled the brightest and sunk some of the greatest corporate ships in the world.</p><p name="40d9" id="40d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a startup guy, so I’m a fan of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">FAILURE</strong>. I think that failure proves that you’re doing something really cutting edge, or at the very least something that you didn’t know how to do before. It’s possible that I like failure because I have done it so much. Over the past 19 years I have started more business than a millennial has had jobs. My failure rate is 75%. 75% of the businesses I’ve started have failed. Many within the first 18 months, which puts me smack back in the exact statistical place that most businesses find themselves. This is something that startups inherently understand. They need to push really hard and risk failure to find any kind of innovative success. This is also a luxury that bigger business don’t believe they have. There is often no appetite for failure in a corporate environment. People are rewarded for status quo, not for risk and failure.</p><p name="aba7" id="aba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine if that’s how we started out life, being rewarded for doing more of the same.</p><p name="da0b" id="da0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you remember when you started walking? No? Me neither, that would be insane. But because you don’t remember it, it’s likely that you have never really analysed the process you underwent to learn how to walk.</p><p name="db7f" id="db7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">BABY ANALOGY — gifs of babies learning to walk</strong></p><p name="d715" id="d715" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you start out walking you’re expected to pull yourself on your bum for a bit where you’ll inevitably run into things like the wall or the dog and have a bit of a cry. Then you’ll crawl on all fours and graze your knee, think about not crawling but carry on. Then you’re expected to stand up, hobble around and fall over on to your nappy for a soft landing. You’ll likely bump your head, fall over, sometimes break a bone and have a good cry. But you get up, dust yourself off and carry on trying to walk until you string your first steps together and fall over again. You don’t stop there with these few steps as a mode of transport, no, you try to string more steps together.</p><p name="b14c" id="b14c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You successfully bum-shuffled, crawled, stood and then walked. You did not let your success while bum-hopping prevent you from trying to next most difficult thing you’ve ever done. Nope, you progressed, you drove forward, in your wee brain you were innovating! No one had ever done anything like this before. Your parents clearly agreed because they were right there with their camcorders filming you, screaming at your brother or sister to come and see you… walking.You managed to increased your output and really drove yourself forward, literally to be able to eventually walk. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[image/gif of parents applauding baby walking]</em></strong></p><p name="e559" id="e559" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is unfortunately not how businesses today operate in general. Most business find their happy bum-shuffle rhythm and then double down on bum-shuffling. They find better ways to bum-shuffle. They try to make it easier and cheaper for the teams to facilitate bum-shuffling. (Am I saying “bum-shuffle too much”?) They expand their operations to be enable people all over the world to help them bum-shuffle better and faster while charging a small fee for the bum-shuffling services. And then… you guessed it… bum-shuffling goes out of fashion… Or a competitor learns how to crawl.</p><p name="8d7e" id="8d7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often Curiosity falls away and comfort takes over. There are a few reasons that comfort and defensive become the business strategy.</p><p name="6ad1" id="6ad1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shareholder value, efficiency and I believe hiring has a lot to do with why big business become complacent and hold back on their curiosity.</p><p name="7493" id="7493" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The People</strong></p><p name="caa0" id="caa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/why-goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-takes-subway-gets-his-own-coffee.html" data-href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/why-goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-takes-subway-gets-his-own-coffee.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/why-goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-takes-subway-gets-his-own-coffee.html</a></p><p name="8f44" id="8f44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my experience, startup founders are:</p><p name="1973" id="1973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Curious</p><p name="2092" id="2092" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Obsessive</p><p name="049f" id="049f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Resilient</p><p name="496a" id="496a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love Failure</p><p name="4a2b" id="4a2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hungry</p><p name="93a9" id="93a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ambitious</p><p name="b04d" id="b04d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Utopian</p><p name="1a69" id="1a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Expert Generalists</strong></p><p name="9ef9" id="9ef9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is actually a more scientific name for these kinds of people: Expert Generalists.

No one gets a “20 percent time” packet at orientation, or pushed into distracting themselves with a side project. Twenty percent time has always operated on a somewhat ad hoc basis, providing an outlet for the company’s brightest, most restless, and most persistent employees — for people determined to see an idea through to completion, come hell or high water.</p><p name="ea66" id="ea66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But Google did not invent the idea of free time to explore. Back in the 1970s, 3M allowed their scientists 15% of their time to explore in a bottom up scientific percolation. Do you know 3M? Scotch Tape, sticky tape, Post-its, that’s 3M.</p><p name="f319" id="f319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Scotch — FIND A PHOTO OF SCOTCH TAPE — tape was invented by a guy called Richard Gurley Drew. He worked at Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) in 1902. Back then 3M was a sandpaper company.</p><p name="18a6" id="18a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 1920s, a two-tone paint job was popular for cars and a headache for automotive painters. The two-tone look was created by painting the car one color, applying a barrier of some sort to the painted portion, and then painting the next section. In order to get around the difficulties of this type of paint job, painters and mechanics tested out different ways to achieve the look. Unfortunately, their attempts tended to be less than successful. Some automotive shops would glue newspapers over the already painted sections while others used tape to prevent paint transfer. However those techniques often left a sticky residue on the paint that was difficult to remove. Sometimes, it would even mean the painters had to do the entire paint job over again.</p><p name="441a" id="441a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of Drew’s responsibilities at 3M was to deliver samples of sandpaper to local automotive shops for testing, where he often overheard workers who were painting complain about the problems with tape used for these paint jobs. The twenty-three year old then lab assistant got the idea to create a new tape that would create a seal so that the paint wouldn’t get through and yet also come off clean without leaving any sticky residue that ruined the paint finish. Drew used the adhesive that 3M utilized in the construction of its sandpaper as a starting point. From there, it took him two years of experimentation with different types of adhesives that he applied to a crepe paper backing to come up with the right combination. Thus, what would be called “Scotch” Masking Tape was born in 1925.</p><p name="b9d1" id="b9d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine if Drew’s bosses refused his curiosity and stifled his attempts when he failed. Imagine if 3M was still trying to survive as a sandpaper company.</p><p name="9ce6" id="9ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gmail — tell the story</p><p name="c8c8" id="c8c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adsense — How does google make money?

That kid who learned to walk became curious about the world around her and she wanted more from life. To do that she needed more than a faster way to walk. She needed to learn how to fly.</p><p name="1356" id="1356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s this curiosity that I believe is at the heart of any company’s continued success and profitability.</p><p name="afbc" id="afbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more curious you are the more you’re going to want to learn about new and interesting verticals, businesses, business models, team members, corporate structures and everything and anything else that can enhance your businesses experience of the world and grow your impact on it.</p><p name="e52a" id="e52a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a survey conducted of more than 3,000 employees from a wide range of firms and industries, only about 24% reported feeling curious in their jobs on a regular basis, and about 70% said they face barriers to asking more questions at work.</p><p name="a5df" id="a5df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When curiosity is triggered, we are less likely to fall prey to confirmation bias — you know when you search for facts that back up your already existing beliefs, rather than search for evidence that may confirm we are wrong. Curiosity often prevents this.</p><p name="d07b" id="d07b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In her research, <a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=francesca%20gino" data-href="https://hbr.org/search?term=francesca%20gino" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Francesca Gino</a> confirms that encouraging people to be curious generates workplace improvements. For one study I recruited about 200 employees working in various companies and industries. Twice a week for four weeks, half of them received a text message at the start of their workday that read, “What is one topic or activity you are curious about today? What is one thing you usually take for granted that you want to ask about? Please make sure you ask a few ‘Why questions’ as you engage in your work throughout the day. Please set aside a few minutes to identify how you’ll approach your work today with these questions in mind.”</p><p name="a83c" id="a83c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other half (the control group) received a message designed to trigger reflection but not raise their curiosity: “What is one topic or activity you’ll engage in today? What is one thing you usually work on or do that you’ll also complete today? Please make sure you think about this as you engage in your work throughout the day. Please set aside a few minutes to identify how you’ll approach your work today with these questions in mind.”</p><p name="1cc2" id="1cc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After four weeks, the participants in the first group scored higher than the others on questions assessing their innovative behaviors at work, such as whether they had made constructive suggestions for implementing solutions to pressing organizational problems.</p><p name="787e" id="787e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">FAILURE</strong></p><p name="c523" id="c523" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But here’s the thing; With great curiosity comes great failure.</strong></p><p name="4183" id="4183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How you deal with failure in your organisation likely needs to change.</p><p name="deca" id="deca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s how most businesses manage failure: They don’t. Fear of rejection prevents people from trying to find new ways to do things, new ways to make money and new ways to do old things.</p><p name="2cef" id="2cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Protecting profit won’t allow you to thrive.</p><p name="7a6e" id="7a6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have established the way that you make money and the thing that you do. You’ve established your internal processes, your hierarchy and you know how things work. And that’s it. Most businesses never move beyond this. Most businesses stick to the status quo, they don’t poke the bear, they don’t challenge the norm and seek the blue oceans that hold the most fish and the most diverse offering of fish.</p><p name="27e1" id="27e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The two are intrinsically tied together. You can’t be curious and try to do something new and expect not to fail while you get good at it and start to make money. Imagine learning how to walk but never expecting to or being allowed to fall over. When you did fall over you’d be devastated and the people around you would fire you for trying to walk and you’d never try again. You’d be a 50 year old crawling adult.</p><p name="26eb" id="26eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How you deal with and embrace failure talks directly to this theory. If you prevent your team from trying things, being curious and exploring then you prevent them from failing, sure, but you also prevent them from trying. You know what happens when you try?</p><p name="f64a" id="f64a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things like Gmail and Adsense at Google.</p><p name="ec49" id="ec49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Education (Finland school system)</strong></p><p name="9859" id="9859" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just like most people.</p><p name="36b6" id="36b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most people get stuck and frustrated and never get off that mouse wheel.
