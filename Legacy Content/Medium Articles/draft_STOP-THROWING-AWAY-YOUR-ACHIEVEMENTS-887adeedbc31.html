I’m not alone in this, nor am I special when it comes to feelings of insecurity, inadequacy and fear of being found out to be a fraud.</p><p name="247f" id="247f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Almost every high-achieving person I’ve ever met has verbalised the fear that if someone scratches a little bit below the surface, they’ll find a fraud.</p><p name="52ef" id="52ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have spent hundreds of hours struggling to figure out where these feelings come from and why I can’t shake them. Do I need to work harder, learn more and execute better than I do already? Should I study more? Seek a mentor? Find a therapist and work through my daddy issues (we all have daddy issues)?</p><p name="8a4e" id="8a4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did all of the above, but the syndrome persists.</p><p name="f9ec" id="f9ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then a few years ago, I started coaching entrepreneurs in high-performing businesses and noticed a trend in their approach to their own achievements.</p><p name="a9df" id="a9df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When many of the people I coach see colleagues or competitors achieve something amazing, they can immediately acknowledge how smart, gifted, talented and exceptional that person is and are happy to verbalise this and praise these people publicly. However, when we try to talk about what they have accomplished (even in a private coaching session), they dismiss their own achievements and chalk them up to luck, timing, their team, a good investor, a great client, a partner who helped them or a tiny bit of advice they read online. Any reason not to own their achievements.</p><p name="f947" id="f947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some reason, high-achievers just can’t see their own achievements for what they are. We blur them, we distort them, and we twist them around so that they no longer look or feel like achievements that belong to us.</p><p name="47e4" id="47e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, there is no “I” in team, but there sure as hell is an “I” in “win” and sometimes <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I win</em>.</p><p name="75b1" id="75b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes I did something amazing without help.</p><p name="2632" id="2632" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes I orchestrated a calculated strategic move that generated millions of dollars in revenue and changed the shape of my company.</p><p name="e81a" id="e81a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes, just sometimes, I win without help or at the very least, I lead a team of people who follow my instructions, and we win because I was at the helm.</p><p name="7d06" id="7d06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I call this <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Achievement Dysmorphia</strong> — an inability to recognise and own your accomplishments.</p><p name="cf58" id="cf58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think about someone in your life who impresses you. Everything they do seems to work out. They always look incredible, they beam confidence when they smile, and they make everyone around them feel like the superhero version of themselves. Every move they make is brilliant and people shower them with the spoils of victory.</p><p name="77a5" id="77a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You look at what they have achieved and credit them for their hard work, strategic skill and ability to execute better than anyone else. You give them direct and immediate credit in your mind for what they have achieved. Whether you like it or not, you credit them; even if you begrudge them for their success, you attribute it to them.</p><p name="c8cc" id="c8cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, think about your own achievements.</p><p name="75a5" id="75a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What was the last thing you accomplished? Hit a deadline at work? Received a raise? Wrote a book? Ran a faster mile than you ever have? Lifted more at the gym than you ever have? Raised a kid who isn’t an asshole?</p><p name="e4f8" id="e4f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you look at this achievement, how do you explain it? Do you call it luck or attribute it partially to someone else, or maybe you credit your team and dismiss your involvement?</p><p name="9089" id="9089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is Achievement Dysmorphia in action</strong>; Our inability to recognise our achievements for what they actually are is crippling us and we don’t even know it.</p><p name="6947" id="6947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We dismiss our achievements, our success, our ability to do something remarkable without help from others. We push aside our ability to put in the hard work, grind through tough times, and make carefully calculated strategic decisions.</p><p name="4960" id="4960" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In effect, we give away our achievements and our track record because we can’t fathom owning our achievements.</p><p name="4653" id="4653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m sick and tired of people receiving an award and thanking everything in their lives until the award show producers have to usher them off with music. I want to see someone receive an Oscar and thank themselves. I want to see someone win a Grammy and stand up and say: “I did this. I worked hard. I toiled. I struggled. I ground it out, with the help of my team, of course. But I am proud of myself for winning this award. I did it!”</p><p name="c9d6" id="c9d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We live in a world where it’s bad to admit to being good.</p><p name="96d8" id="96d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We live in a world where we marvel at the greats but demand they never take credit for their success, or we brand them arrogant and try to tear them down. We put people on a pedestal and then ask them to ignore how they got there in the first place. We live in a world where success is knocked down because you are too young, too old, too rich, too poor, too black, too white, too male, too female or too much of anything.</p><p name="8aee" id="8aee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not arrogant to acknowledge that you have done something difficult and done it better than anyone else. It’s honest. Being humble doesn’t mean dismissing your own achievements or involvement in the success of something great.</p><p name="f2e9" id="f2e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being honest with ourselves about our abilities and achievements will help us manage Imposter Syndrome (it never goes away, trust me) and helps us understand where we can do better next time.</p><p name="3b15" id="3b15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Constantly attributing our achievements to others might feel like the appropriate thing to do, but it is damaging our egos negatively and influences our self-talk, sense of self and ability to be honest with ourselves.</p><p name="1914" id="1914" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Own your success. Own your failure. Drop your ego and be honest with yourself.</p><p name="5e55" id="5e55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have the self-awareness to recognise your own shortcomings, and you can combine this with an ability to acknowledge your own achievements as yours, then you will be able to realistically assess your feelings of Imposter Syndrome and overcome them in the moment.</p><p name="ef8c" id="ef8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If, however, you never give yourself credit for doing something amazing, difficult or complex, then you will constantly be left needing other people’s approval, warping your own abilities and allowing people to push you aside.</p><p name="ad43" id="ad43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It takes time to figure out what you are good at, and what you are bad at and to develop the self-confidence to admit when you have done something incredible. Take the time and start with something small today.</p><p name="8dab" id="8dab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The next time someone congratulates you or thanks you for doing something, just thank them for the compliment and move on.</p></div></div></section><section name="3d1f" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4fc7" id="4fc7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This article was originally published at </em><a href="https://nicharalambous.com/blog/achievement-dysmorphia" data-href="https://nicharalambous.com/blog/achievement-dysmorphia" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nharry.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em></p><p name="bbd0" id="bbd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I work as a </em><a href="https://nicharalambous.com/business-coach" data-href="https://nicharalambous.com/business-coach" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">business consultant and leadership coach</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, contact me and let’s work to build you a better life and a better business. </em></p></div></div></section>
